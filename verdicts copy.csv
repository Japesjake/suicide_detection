0.0,dummy,data,"I feel like I’m stuck in this stage in my relationship where we keep seeing each other’s flaws and tension is high. Lately, I’ve been feeling really low, even though I act like everything’s fine. I know he’s been distant and I’m almost certain he’s going to break up with me soon. It’s like there’s this constant, heavy dot of anxiety in my chest, and I don’t know how to deal with it. I just feel helpless and scared about what’s coming. I keep replaying every little thing he said or did, trying to guess when it will happen. I feel trapped in my own thoughts, like I can’t breathe, but I can’t bring myself to let go either. Part of me wants to fight for us, but another part knows it’s over. I just want to feel calm again, to stop this heavy knot in my chest, but right now, it feels impossible.",True,depression,i’m 26 turning 27 in June 2026 and i’m really struggling with the reality that i’m getting older and running out of time.

,"Not sure what flair but here it goes Everyday I wake up of wanting to end myself. Having thoughts everyday 24/7 on when should I do it. I also have been saving money so I can least leave a savings to my family. I tried exercising lost about 10kgs (im obese btw) and though the thoughts would go away but even during that time when I am doing some workout I keep thinking its not worth it you are not going to make it you are a fuck up. Then that 10kg came back and now I fear I may get diabetes, my family has a history of it. I tried all of the distractions. I keep getting back to that point that i just keep eating and eating and just doomscrolling just staring at my screen. Even at work I just want it to end. Been thinking about it by 30 I might do it and I am just counting down. Even found a way to do it painless.",True,,,,,

,"I wish there was ethical suicide where I live. I wish people could understand that I don’t want to be here and I wish it wouldn’t affect them. I’m not doing anything bc my mom would be sad. But so I much I wish she could just let me go. I’m so tired. I’ve been feeling this for 20 years. I have gotten helped. I have diagnosis. I have been medicated. I have been hospitalized. I’ve done it all and I’m just so tired. I wish more than anything that I could just feel like not dying was a solution. I wish I could see the merit in existing but so taxing. I’m so tired. I am jobless I don’t even do anything, my mom is kind enough to just let me exist in her house for free as long as volunteer sometimes and even that’s too much. What is wrong with me. I wish there was just scan they could do on my brain and it’s x, y, and z. This is the treatment and I wish it would work. The last time I was taking meds I was on 11. 11 mediations for me to be capable of showering and talking, not even well, just function-able.

,"No escape from loneliness and the weight of depression. Life has always felt like this, since childhood....an unending echo of silence. I long for those days when childhood was still mine, before the world grew cold and silent. As I’ve grown older, all I see around me is emptiness, a vast, single dimension where I am utterly alone. It’s as if I never chose this life; it feels predestined, as if fate carved out this path for me.",True,,,,,

,"I’m 16m and ever since covid, I just don’t feel attached to much of anything going on around me. I feel so stuck in my head, over-analyzing everything I do or have ever done. I just don’t feel truly alive and my life feels dream like. It’s like the world around me doesn’t seem as like, big, I guess, like I’m not really looking at shit, I don’t know how to describe it. I’m really anxious and I think that might be why. This past summer it was really bad, I never really felt awake and alive, everything felt so hazy and far apart. When school started again, shit got so much better and I felt more alive and I stopped thinking about it as much. But recently it’s been worse and it’s affecting my mental health and how I perform at school and work. I think I might just be spiraling and thinking about it too much, but honesty I just can’t stop being stuck in my head. I also can’t stop dwelling on shit I did in the past and this gets even worse when I smoke. I honestly just don’t know what to do at this point, it really sucks, I’m just genuinely trapped in metacognition and my own conscious. What the fuck do I do?",True,,,,,

,"So my cat recently had 4 very cute kittens, truth is though I can’t keep them all so i decided to give them out to nice homes where they could be nice and protected. I been in the process of neutering and stuff like that. When I told my family about this my little sister immediately wanted to come over to my apartment and see them. I decided why not, maybe human smells around the kittens would help them warm up around the idea of humans. When she came over I noticed she was very rough around them and crossing kitten boundaries. (Just grabbing them off my cat when my cat was breastfeeding, picking them off when they were scared, not holding them properly, etc). I told her how to interact with them properly and that was that. A few days after that I finally found proper homes for them but that’s when she texted me asking if she could have one of them. I already had 4 houses which 1) I didn’t wanna go off my word and tell one of them there is no more kitten and 2) she doesn’t handle them properly. I wanted them to go in nice houses where they were happy. My sister got mad when I told her no and now she’s not talking to me. AITA",False,,,,,

,"AITA for telling my bsf the day after drinking to take down a post that looks like we’re kissing in it ? This girl (24) pressured me (22F) to keep drinking after i told her i was done and its my fault i drank them yes. However she kept pouring me shots and then got mad when i didnt want to take them so i took them. Anyways we got to the point of blackout drunk and she ended up posting a video where it looks like we kissed and my boyfriend obviously didn’t like it and neither did I mainly because I was drunk asf and didn’t remember half the night after the 5th shot, then i was passed out on her bedroom floor. The next day rolls around and im nervous asf bc i truthfully didnt recall it all that well but i hate confrontation so i told her yea it was okay not knowing what she was gonna post and she sent it to me for me to post the other ones so i did … again i fucked up. The next day i regret everything because i didnt wanna do it in the first place so i texted her saying i took my down and that id like her to take hers down because it made me uncomfortable. She told me no and got defensive. So i buckled down like i shouldve in the beginning and she said she understood and took the video down. I asked if she was upset and she said no. So i text her the next day thinking everything is cool and shes short w me. I go on tiktok and shes posting about how her new friend is so much better than me on Snapchat saying how her new friend wouldnt make her feel how i did. Now im upset bc why couldnt she just talk to me about it. So i made a post aimed at her… and she texts my mother instead of me asking for her hoodie back, like she cant text me and now im bothered",False,,,,,
,Me and three other friends have a group chat where we make plans to hangout and usually watch movies. We’ve seen two movies so far and we are pretty active in the group chat. Recently one of members added another mutual all of us have. The person who added him did it without talking about it at all. When he added him I was a little wary of him being in the group chat because we’ve already had plans and have hung out before. My point is I felt like they shouldn’t have added him even though he is a friend of all of us. He’s still in the group chat but I’ve made it known that I feel like he shouldn’t be added in the group chat. Maybe if he was added before the second hangout and we actually talked about adding someone else I would have probably been more accepting. I think we should just keep the original member and I feel like added someone so late just doesn’t fit right. Please tell me what you would do and if I’m the bad person here.,False,,,,,
