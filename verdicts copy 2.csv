,depression,True,"As someone who’s gone through depression in the past and still faces it partly today, i’ve always found a great way of working through it was just talking. Thought i’d put this out there so if anyone ever wanted to talk privately they could, i’m always here for yall 🫶"
,depression,True,I don't know what would help besides killing me blowing my brains out all over the wall but I just want it to stop I can't handle living anymore 27 years was enough I want off stop it please
,depression,True,I am 27m. I have been battling gambling addiction for a while. I always tell myself i would stop. This time i fucked up bad.
,depression,False,"I was moneyless cause i gambled away my paycheck. It was going well, i didn't need any money so it was fine. Then, the other day, i got fined while driving. I asked for a cash advance on my paycheck, i wanted a small sum (paycheck is due in less than a week anyway), and my boss gave me almost all of it instead. I gambled it away. Again."
,depression,True,"I wanted to use that money to go on vacation, to take a break from my bleak life. Now i can't."
,depression,True,"27 years and i squandered away everything. I have a good paying job, i should have a lot of money, instead this year i got wrapped into this and can't find a way out."
,depression,True,I am beyond help.
,sad,False,"Does anyone else feel so shy that it actually makes you sad? Like you want to talk, connect, and be part of things… but your body just freezes. How do you deal with that?”"
,sad,True,"Not sure what flair but here it goes Everyday I wake up of wanting to end myself. Having thoughts everyday 24/7 on when should I do it. I also have been saving money so I can least leave a savings to my family. I tried exercising lost about 10kgs (im obese btw) and though the thoughts would go away but even during that time when I am doing some workout I keep thinking its not worth it you are not going to make it you are a fuck up. Then that 10kg came back and now I fear I may get diabetes, my family has a history of it. I tried all of the distractions. I keep getting back to that point that i just keep eating and eating and just doomscrolling just staring at my screen. Even at work I just want it to end. Been thinking about it by 30 I might do it and I am just counting down. Even found a way to do it painless."
,sad,False,I 24 F have essentially been single forever. Had a high school boyfriend but nothing serious in adulthood. And to be clear- I’m not desperately seeking a relationship. It’s definitely something I desire but something genuine.
,sad,True,Family was strict growing up so when I became an adult they just expected me to know how to date out of nowhere. I didn’t start feeling this sad about it until ALL of my friends are in serious relationships.. I barely got to see them before and now almost never. I don’t feel that I’m ugly so maybe I’m just a late bloomer. And I know I shouldn’t compare myself but I’m now really feeling the loneliness .
,sad,False,"Not even exaggerating but everyone in my immediate circle (household,friends,even long distance friends) is in a committed relationship.  And not to sound cringe but I feel left out because I’m the ONLY single person I know so it makes me feel something is the problem with me. And I try to fake the funk like I’m completely happy but deep down I desire romance,love,companionship etc"

,confessions,False,"I was setting people up on various gay dating apps and asking if they would want to pay for sex, (usually posing as underage sometimes not) then i would meet with them and run off with the money. Now i know this isn’t terrible, but a couple of these ordeals went wrong and got very physical. Now, I’m afraid to put my face out there as i’ve (stupidly) done this with no disguise and have since realized how fucking dumb and immoral this was, since i did not care then."
,confessions,False,Im worried that this will bite me in the future and i don’t know what to do about it.
,confessions,False,Around the same time i was doing this i smashed a house window of a person who was trying to lure underage girls to his house to drink (for sex) and was hitting girls and bragging about it online. (Somehow still has friends)
,confessions,False,"Well, they found out it was me. Again, Im just worried about the future even though it has been a long-ish time. This person also said they’d get revenge “when i forget about it”."
,confessions,True,"And while i know these things are vile, i am no stranger to sin, mild or severe. So, I have no right to be judge or executioner, but i let the constant weed smoking, friends, pent up anger, and ego boosts from a deep pit of insecurity fuel my actions. I don’t know what to think about it but the stress of this on top of a lot of other years of ongoing family and personal issues are hindering my ability of thinking in general."
,confessions,True,"I (f25) feel deeply confused, hurt and emotionally exhausted by my mum and my sister, and I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel or what the “right” reaction is anymore. My mum has always had serious anger issues and when I try to speak to her about how she’s hurt me, she immediately deflects, raises her voice and turns it around on me instead of taking any accountability, and her shouting is genuinely scary and overwhelming. After one of her outbursts, I’m just expected to forget it and go back to normal, and I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells because if she hears even the slightest “off” tone in my voice she kicks off again. My sister, who is 23, has always been horrible to me — she speaks in a rude, sharp tone, says things like “what?” when I talk, controls the entire house and dictates how quiet it must be at night, and my parents just follow along like they’re afraid of her. I can’t ever speak up about her behaviour because my mum instantly jumps to her defence and says things like “that’s just who she is,” “she’s a grown woman, I can’t punish her,” or “I’m trying the soft approach,” which basically tells me it’s okay for her to treat me badly. What hurts even more is that she is perfectly capable of being kind and respectful, because she is lovely to other people like my cousin, apologising constantly and worrying about upsetting him — which proves to me that the way she treats me is a choice that’s enabled by my mum. Since being in hospital on telemetry for a week and being diagnosed with epilepsy, and finding out about SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy)— something my family knows very well about — my ability to cope with stress has changed, and it is devastating that my mum still shouts, argues and creates a hostile environment knowing the impact it has on me. Stress is a trigger for s3izure. The other day when she was shouting at my dad, I finally reacted (which I rarely do), and she went absolutely crazy at me to the point I walked out, yet when they were messaging me for two hours saying they were worried, as soon as I came back she kicked off again. The next day she expected everything to just be normal, and when I stayed quiet to protect myself, she could tell I was distant, and I’ve been struggling to forgive her ever since. Even when she apologises, she only does it when I’m away at work or my boyfriend’s, and then when I’m upset again she takes it back and minimises what she did, saying things like “what did I even do that was so bad?” or “you’re only angry because according to you I was rude,” and when I mention the apology, she twists it into “so my apology meant nothing then?” which makes me feel guilty and doubting myself. She then says she’s a terrible mum and her family is broken, and because she and my dad barely speak and my sister treats her badly too, I feel like I’m abandoning her when I’m just trying to protect myself, which hurts because I’m the only one who really shows her kindness and respect. I also feel torn because when she’s not angry she can be kind, funny and caring, which makes me doubt my own feelings and makes it even harder to stay upset. On top of that, I feel pressure because it’s almost Christmas and she’s 59 and I worry “what if this is her last Christmas and I’ve made it miserable?” which leaves me stuck between my pain and my guilt. I don’t want to leave my home, my dog or the comfort and privacy of my own space, and even though my boyfriend would let me stay with him, I’d feel like a burden or judged in his family’s home. Right now it feels like when I speak I’m punished, when I’m silent I’m punished, and the only way to survive is to swallow everything and let my sister continue controlling everyone, even though it is slowly breaking me inside."
,confessions,True,"So I am a dentist ,I am 26 now  and I don't have a job .working for 30k in Bangalore after studying so much and getting tortured for so many months i finally left .and now I am jobless.feels like I am not worth of anything ,tired of asking money from dad .i want to try something new and earn but I dont know what should I do? help me!"
,confessions,False,Obviously I thought it was weird and when he talked about it made me uncomfortable. I figured I couldn’t judge them since they’re both consenting adults sooo. Still I had a crush on this guy and I feel guilty for having wanted a man with that kinda family relationship🤢.
,confessions,False,"It didn’t really start to bother me until I was telling a friend who knew about it, that my fwb was going on a family vacation and I’d be sad not to see him for a while. My friend laughed and said “so he’s gonna be fucking his sister for the whole month?”"
,confessions,True,"M37 here. I was straight and married till 2022. Somehow back then I felt bored with life, with wife et al.. Ended up cheated on her, then experimented a bit more, had gay sex and a whole new world of pleasure opened up. After some escapades met a genuinely compassionate man, who was also married then, and something immediately clicked. We both came out, got divorced and started a new life together. It has been wonderful 3 years but there's trouble in paradise. I'm not all getting arosed by my partner or by any men for that matter now. Its like my brain had enough thrill from it and now completely rejecting it. I've gone thru enough pain and caused enough turmoil once already, and dont know whats happening and why its happening. Never thought sexuality had on and off phases. I'm confused and to add on to that, feeling guilty for first making my ex wife go thru this and now my partner, both whom are wonderful individuals. They didn't/don't deserves this for sure. Is it just me or anyone had similar experience?"
