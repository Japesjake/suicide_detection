,depression,True,True,"With poltics, AI, cooporations winning as I battle internal loneliness and depression, it feels like it'll only get worse from here. As an aspiring artist and animator wanting to get by and be lovedI have therapy but it can only do so much every weekI can barely feel anything these days due to my extreme anxiety or somethingr/mentalhealth keeps ignoring my postsPlease, I just want to have hope, I just want myself back, and the inconsiderate are driving me crazy, am I a good person?"
,depression,True,True,"I understand that many people have this thought cross their mind every so often. But at what point is it too much? I’ve considered every option and path in which my life could take from this point on, but they all seem like a lie and not attainable.I’m in my early 30s, I have done essentially nothing in my life that holds any value. I have no money, I’ve fucked myself out of most everything I had, and quit just about every endeavor I’ve ever attempted. I think it’s too late to salvage the idea of an actual career, too late to convince another human that I’m worth spending time with. I hate myself, no other person can love such that doesn’t love themself. Everywhere I go I see all these happy people, companionship. I just sit alone and wallow in the depths of contemplation as to why I decided to wake up and give another day a go.It’s not worth it. The only real negative to suicide is it makes people who knew you feel bad for a couple days. They move on, everything does. Soon enough you’re just a once per year reminiscence, everyone has lives that they must prioritize. I just don’t understand the meaning in going on."
,depression,False,False,"This vent goes out to all my fellow exhausted humans ❤️‍🩹 All I wanted to do tonight was chill after a long cold day at work and have failed doing that successfully. I'm 24m living with my parents for the time being, and I love them, but boy can they be hard to be around sometimes. Trying to have a chill dinner watching key and peele and it's just constant ramblings about random objects in the background of scenes that turn into long conversations about nothing between the two of them. Hell even when they miss a word the other one says, theres another 5 minute conversation! I'm getting so tired and just want a chill night, and I try to do that seemingly every night but it doesn't work out. My parents both have ADHD (untreated by the way) and I am fairly certain I am autistic, and I have had many many conversations with them about how I want to get officially diagnosed but they never led to anything. I feel like the combination of our conditions has been preventing our growth as people, especially mine. I am starting to feel the need to move out but it just makes me really sad because I love them so much, but I may just be clouded by nostalgia. I did not make a single friend throughout college despite making an effort to 5 out of 7 days a week, and am just left feeling like a loser. I don't have any connections with other young people for living situations, and I just feel like I'm watching my 20s go by. Sometimes I'll hang out with my one old friend from high school when he's in town, but he always has much better things going on elsewhere/at college. I would love to move in somewhere with my girlfriend whom I adore, but due to a serious bipolar episode/attempt back in May she is still living in a group home. She is a beautiful yet tormented soul, and that in of itself has been a huge thing to process these past few months. Thankfully we're at the point where she can spend nights/weekeds but sometimes I just still get really sad about the whole thing. Anyways, just a really sad lonely night. I'm gonna leave it here for now, but if any of this resonates with anyone I would really appreciate just a hello from out in the digital void 🥲"
,sad,False,False,"Does anyone else feel so shy that it actually makes you sad? Like you want to talk, connect, and be part of things… but your body just freezes. How do you deal with that?”"
,sad,True,True,"Not sure what flair but here it goes Everyday I wake up of wanting to end myself. Having thoughts everyday 24/7 on when should I do it. I also have been saving money so I can least leave a savings to my family. I tried exercising lost about 10kgs (im obese btw) and though the thoughts would go away but even during that time when I am doing some workout I keep thinking its not worth it you are not going to make it you are a fuck up. Then that 10kg came back and now I fear I may get diabetes, my family has a history of it. I tried all of the distractions. I keep getting back to that point that i just keep eating and eating and just doomscrolling just staring at my screen. Even at work I just want it to end. Been thinking about it by 30 I might do it and I am just counting down. Even found a way to do it painless."
,sad,False,False,"I 24 F have essentially been single forever. Had a high school boyfriend but nothing serious in adulthood. And to be clear- I’m not desperately seeking a relationship. It’s definitely something I desire but something genuine.Family was strict growing up so when I became an adult they just expected me to know how to date out of nowhere. I didn’t start feeling this sad about it until ALL of my friends are in serious relationships.. I barely got to see them before and now almost never. I don’t feel that I’m ugly so maybe I’m just a late bloomer. And I know I shouldn’t compare myself but I’m now really feeling the loneliness .Not even exaggerating but everyone in my immediate circle (household,friends,even long distance friends) is in a committed relationship.  And not to sound cringe but I feel left out because I’m the ONLY single person I know so it makes me feel something is the problem with me. And I try to fake the funk like I’m completely happy but deep down I desire romance,love,companionship etcI"
,confessions,False,False,"24 M here My big cousin has a nice body tall slim and a big butt for her size I used to be at her house while she was in her bra and panties just walking around comfortable with my cousin which is her brother she's way older than us I would act like I wasn't watching but would have to hide my boner..anyways she made a private snap i sent $10 to be added I really thought she was gone curse me out but she added me, all I seen was her getting hit from the back, riding I slid up with the 👀💰 emojis I thought she was gone curse me tf out she told me "" lil nigga we cousins all I can do for you is give you a handjob and let you smack my ass it just wouldn't feel right you know?"" I ain't never felt so embarrassed we don't ever make things weird but damn I can't believe I stooped that low."
,confessions,False,False,I have a kink for wedgies and love receiving them. Preferably from women but I just love being a big nerd and having my tighty whities pulled over my head.
,confessions,False,False,"I wish that I wasn’t on prescription medication so I could start doing cocaine again it was fun except for one time when I almost got into a fight with an old man, but that was a rare exception. I have a wooden coffee table, so it’s perfect and I make more money now so I can afford it."
