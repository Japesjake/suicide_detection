      "Had good job as resident physician, still have it, but got two dui’s in the last 4 months the second one on a suspended license. I was coming back from the bar with my friend. He was driving. He says to me that hes not good to drive and I take over. I got pulled over 500 feet from my driveway. I was supposed to get my license back Dec 17. Now, I face loss of my medical licensure, I am beyond broke from both dui lawyer and medical license lawyer. I have no friends where I live, and where I live is not walkable at all. Every day is misery and I cannot see the light. Someday i’ll be an attending and make lots of money, sure, but who cares. I hate my job, i’m all alone, and this criminal record will taint my reputation forever. I know I am focusing on all of the bad and none of the good. But i rather not live anymore. I don’t want to deal with these problems. I miss my old life, carefree, going skiing every weekend, going out to the bars by myself and trying (unsuccessfully) to talk to women. Granted, i was miserable then. But nothing compared to this. I always wanted to go skiing in british columbia and now that is going to be impossible. I always wanted to be a pilot and now that is impossible. I don’t know how to cope with my new reality. Just because of a couple stupid mistakes. I spend all day wishing I could go back in time and undo my actions and it tortures me every second of every day\n",
      "Going through a lot of seasonal depression lately. I’ve been depressed and anxious my entire life but it’s worse lately. I live in a rural area and I don’t really like the people I work with, so I have no one to talk to. I feel like every interaction is unfulfilling. Life is so dreary lately and I’m so bored, frustrated, and tired.\n",
      "Thinking about ending things. Does anyone care? Idk. All I can think about is ending it. No one loves me. I'm only good for what I can provide. Which is nothing. If I don't hear from anyone I'll just delete this like I do all my other posts after I'm ignored. Figured I'd try one more time before I do something I cant turn back from.\n"
