,depression,True,"I knew this guy for 6 years. He was the most important person in my life. I loved him, like no one I ever loved before. I know the feeling was somewhat reciprocated. He was more mentally stable than me, but I still was his best friend for 6 years. This last year we just stopped talking. I was still texting and calling, but he stopped picking up and texting back. We would see each other in person, but I left that area and he hasn’t talked to me since. I loved him so much and I can’t process this type of pain. other friends have left me, but no one as important as him. How do I cope. I have good friends, but none like him. It hurts so bad."
,depression,True,"I lost my sparkle. I lost everything.... After breakup, I decided to leave the country and go to save some money, for my next trip I planned. Because after every breakup, I had urge to leave and go to chase my dreams. But now it's different. I'm tired, depressed, thinking everyday about ending my life. And it's been a few months, I have felt like that. I still miss him, love him, but he is living his best life without me, without any feelings for me. I'm not sure, if I will ever lose feelings for him. My job sucks, but I need money. I'm riding bicycle for 12km every morning and every evening back to the accommodation after work and here in Netherlands is mainly raining during this time. I barely see the sunlight. Working 10 hours, planting flower bulbs and plants. My colleagues barely speak English and they are always blaming me, when something wrong happened with the orders we've been preparing. I kinda don't have a time for proper sleep, for cooking for myself or having chill or fun. During the weekends, I am mostly sleeping, because I'm so tired and sleep I get during the week days is not enough. I am here alone, I have no one to talk to. Accomodation where I am, which is given by company where I work, sucks. People here are just disgusting. Not cleaning dishes, toilets, there is dirt everywhere. Hot water and heating in the room are excess I don't have rn. Guys in accomodation are drinking almost every evening and talking too loud, shouting at eachother in the end, so I was forced 2x this week to leave the bed and go to ask them to be quiet, because I need to wake up at 5am and coming from work at 6-7pm. So I really don't have a time for anything else. Like thinking about cooking for myself everyday makes me anxious, not only because it takes time I will rather use for sleep, but because of the fact that everything here looks disgusting. Pots are not cleaned, dirty dishes everywhere, I saw mouse in the kitchen 2 days ago too. But I am so scared, to go back home, to my parents house and be unemployed again. Plus I am here alone... I am crying every night, even if I stopped few months ago, because I miss him, miss our relationship and time and I still have feelings for him. I feel like I lost everything and my life just sucks. There is not a single thing that makes me happy or relaxed. Every day I wish I would die, so I will not need to go to work and mainly not feel everything inside. RN I don't know what is the purpose of my life, if I still want to go to Australia. I just wish that someone will be here with me at least to give me a hug everyday, to talk to me or just to be here. Because I know I did a lot of things just by myself, alone and I did them. But now it feels different, because I am already broken inside and not seeing the light in the end of the tunnel. I feel like a loser, I feel like I am not capable. I really don't know what to do... If to stay to save money, but it will sucks or go back home to be unemployed again. And I am so tired, literally I am going back to sleep rn... Sorry I just needed to vent how I feel..."
,depression,True,"I really don’t want to be here anymore. I can’t find joy in anything I do. I feel horrible when I’m awake, I feel awful when I wake up and I only see nightmares. I don’t want to do anything, I get anxious about everything and I’m just so fucking sad all the time. I have no motivation to take care of myself, I don’t want to take care of myself."
,depression,False,I have no friends.
,depression,True,The only reason I’m still here is my cat but I’m sure she would be better without me.
,depression,True,And I have no one to talk to about this. No one understands me.
,depression,True,I’m just done.
,sad,False,"Does anyone else feel so shy that it actually makes you sad? Like you want to talk, connect, and be part of things… but your body just freezes. How do you deal with that?”"
,sad,True,"Not sure what flair but here it goes Everyday I wake up of wanting to end myself. Having thoughts everyday 24/7 on when should I do it. I also have been saving money so I can least leave a savings to my family. I tried exercising lost about 10kgs (im obese btw) and though the thoughts would go away but even during that time when I am doing some workout I keep thinking its not worth it you are not going to make it you are a fuck up. Then that 10kg came back and now I fear I may get diabetes, my family has a history of it. I tried all of the distractions. I keep getting back to that point that i just keep eating and eating and just doomscrolling just staring at my screen. Even at work I just want it to end. Been thinking about it by 30 I might do it and I am just counting down. Even found a way to do it painless."
,sad,False,I 24 F have essentially been single forever. Had a high school boyfriend but nothing serious in adulthood. And to be clear- I’m not desperately seeking a relationship. It’s definitely something I desire but something genuine.
,sad,True,Family was strict growing up so when I became an adult they just expected me to know how to date out of nowhere. I didn’t start feeling this sad about it until ALL of my friends are in serious relationships.. I barely got to see them before and now almost never. I don’t feel that I’m ugly so maybe I’m just a late bloomer. And I know I shouldn’t compare myself but I’m now really feeling the loneliness .
,sad,False,"Not even exaggerating but everyone in my immediate circle (household,friends,even long distance friends) is in a committed relationship.  And not to sound cringe but I feel left out because I’m the ONLY single person I know so it makes me feel something is the problem with me. And I try to fake the funk like I’m completely happy but deep down I desire romance,love,companionship etc"
,sad,False,I
,confessions,True,"When I was 13 I discovered the internet and its dark side, I also discovered sexuality which led me to be groomed... being someone alone and with enormous emotional deprivation my only way of feeling less alone and feeling love was to give my body to older men (+40 years old) some of them were fathers of grandfathers. Their dirty words, their faces, their names resonate in my head every day. I feel dirty, very dirty. I still feel their perverse gaze on me. “Don’t worry, don’t worry” “Do what I tell you” “You’re young, you need this”. The worst part is that I knew it was wrong and that it was unhealthy but I would start again and again because I had the feeling of being loved and less alone just for a moment. The worst part of all this is that once I'm an adult I continue to do it, I continue to give my body to these predators just to feel a little love"
,confessions,False,Ps I work at hooters lol
,confessions,False,"All I want is to make something cool. I want to make something really good, show it to my family and prove to them, and myself, that I deserved patience, love and respect. And I fucking can't."
,confessions,True,Something in me won't let me. The only thing in life that I want and I won't do it. I'm miserable.
,confessions,True,"There's no point if I can't prove it. I'm desperate. I'm too tired for therapy, or for figuring out what's really wrong. All I want is this, and I can't have it. I hate my life."
,confessions,False,"I knew this guy for 6 years. He was the most important person in my life. I loved him, like no one I ever loved before. I know the feeling was somewhat reciprocated.
