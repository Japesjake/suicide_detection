,confessions,True,"M37 here. I was straight and married till 2022. Somehow back then I felt bored with life, with wife et al.. Ended up cheated on her, then experimented a bit more, had gay sex and a whole new world of pleasure opened up. After some escapades met a genuinely compassionate man, who was also married then, and something immediately clicked. We both came out, got divorced and started a new life together. It has been wonderful 3 years but there's trouble in paradise. I'm not all getting arosed by my partner or by any men for that matter now. Its like my brain had enough thrill from it and now completely rejecting it. I've gone thru enough pain and caused enough turmoil once already, and dont know whats happening and why its happening. Never thought sexuality had on and off phases. I'm confused and to add on to that, feeling guilty for first making my ex wife go thru this and now my partner, both whom are wonderful individuals. They didn't/don't deserves this for sure. Is it just me or anyone had similar experience?"
,confessions,False,"I was setting people up on various gay dating apps and asking if they would want to pay for sex, (usually posing as underage sometimes not) then i would meet with them and run off with the money. Now i know this isn’t terrible, but a couple of these ordeals went wrong and got very physical. Now, I’m afraid to put my face out there as i’ve (stupidly) done this with no disguise and have since realized how fucking dumb and immoral this was, since i did not care then."
,confessions,False,Im worried that this will bite me in the future and i don’t know what to do about it.
,confessions,False,Around the same time i was doing this i smashed a house window of a person who was trying to lure underage girls to his house to drink (for sex) and was hitting girls and bragging about it online. (Somehow still has friends)
,confessions,False,"Well, they found out it was me. Again, Im just worried about the future even though it has been a long-ish time. This person also said they’d get revenge “when i forget about it”."
,confessions,True,"And while i know these things are vile, i am no stranger to sin, mild or severe. So, I have no right to be judge or executioner, but i let the constant weed smoking, friends, pent up anger, and ego boosts from a deep pit of insecurity fuel my actions. I don’t know what to think about it but the stress of this on top of a lot of other years of ongoing family and personal issues are hindering my ability of thinking in general."
,confessions,True,"I (f25) feel deeply confused, hurt and emotionally exhausted by my mum and my sister, and I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel or what the “right” reaction is anymore. My mum has always had serious anger issues and when I try to speak to her about how she’s hurt me, she immediately deflects, raises her voice and turns it around on me instead of taking any accountability, and her shouting is genuinely scary and overwhelming. After one of her outbursts, I’m just expected to forget it and go back to normal, and I feel like I’m constantly walking on eggshells because if she hears even the slightest “off” tone in my voice she kicks off again. My sister, who is 23, has always been horrible to me — she speaks in a rude, sharp tone, says things like “what?” when I talk, controls the entire house and dictates how quiet it must be at night, and my parents just follow along like they’re afraid of her. I can’t ever speak up about her behaviour because my mum instantly jumps to her defence and says things like “that’s just who she is,” “she’s a grown woman, I can’t punish her,” or “I’m trying the soft approach,” which basically tells me it’s okay for her to treat me badly. What hurts even more is that she is perfectly capable of being kind and respectful, because she is lovely to other people like my cousin, apologising constantly and worrying about upsetting him — which proves to me that the way she treats me is a choice that’s enabled by my mum. Since being in hospital on telemetry for a week and being diagnosed with epilepsy, and finding out about SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy)— something my family knows very well about — my ability to cope with stress has changed, and it is devastating that my mum still shouts, argues and creates a hostile environment knowing the impact it has on me. Stress is a trigger for s3izure. The other day when she was shouting at my dad, I finally reacted (which I rarely do), and she went absolutely crazy at me to the point I walked out, yet when they were messaging me for two hours saying they were worried, as soon as I came back she kicked off again. The next day she expected everything to just be normal, and when I stayed quiet to protect myself, she could tell I was distant, and I’ve been struggling to forgive her ever since. Even when she apologises, she only does it when I’m away at work or my boyfriend’s, and then when I’m upset again she takes it back and minimises what she did, saying things like “what did I even do that was so bad?” or “you’re only angry because according to you I was rude,” and when I mention the apology, she twists it into “so my apology meant nothing then?” which makes me feel guilty and doubting myself. She then says she’s a terrible mum and her family is broken, and because she and my dad barely speak and my sister treats her badly too, I feel like I’m abandoning her when I’m just trying to protect myself, which hurts because I’m the only one who really shows her kindness and respect. I also feel torn because when she’s not angry she can be kind, funny and caring, which makes me doubt my own feelings and makes it even harder to stay upset. On top of that, I feel pressure because it’s almost Christmas and she’s 59 and I worry “what if this is her last Christmas and I’ve made it miserable?” which leaves me stuck between my pain and my guilt. I don’t want to leave my home, my dog or the comfort and privacy of my own space, and even though my boyfriend would let me stay with him, I’d feel like a burden or judged in his family’s home. Right now it feels like when I speak I’m punished, when I’m silent I’m punished, and the only way to survive is to swallow everything and let my sister continue controlling everyone, even though it is slowly breaking me inside."
,depression,True,"As someone who’s gone through depression in the past and still faces it partly today, i’ve always found a great way of working through it was just talking. Thought i’d put this out there so if anyone ever wanted to talk privately they could, i’m always here for yall 🫶"
,depression,True,I don't know what would help besides killing me blowing my brains out all over the wall but I just want it to stop I can't handle living anymore 27 years was enough I want off stop it please
,depression,True,I am 27m. I have been battling gambling addiction for a while. I always tell myself i would stop. This time i fucked up bad.
,depression,False,"I was moneyless cause i gambled away my paycheck. It was going well, i didn't need any money so it was fine. Then, the other day, i got fined while driving. I asked for a cash advance on my paycheck, i wanted a small sum (paycheck is due in less than a week anyway), and my boss gave me almost all of it instead. I gambled it away. Again."
,depression,True,"I wanted to use that money to go on vacation, to take a break from my bleak life. Now i can't."
,depression,True,"27 years and i squandered away everything. I have a good paying job, i should have a lot of money, instead this year i got wrapped into this and can't find a way out."
,depression,True,I am beyond help.
,sad,False,"Does anyone else feel so shy that it actually makes you sad? Like you want to talk, connect, and be part of things… but your body just freezes. How do you deal with that?”"
,sad,True,"Not sure what flair but here it goes Everyday I wake up of wanting to end myself. Having thoughts everyday 24/7 on when should I do it. I also have been saving money so I can least leave a savings to my family. I tried exercising lost about 10kgs (im obese btw) and though the thoughts would go away but even during that time when I am doing some workout I keep thinking its not worth it you are not going to make it you are a fuck up. Then that 10kg came back and now I fear I may get diabetes, my family has a history of it. I tried all of the distractions. I keep getting back to that point that i just keep eating and eating and just doomscrolling just staring at my screen. Even at work I just want it to end. Been thinking about it by 30 I might do it and I am just counting down. Even found a way to do it painless."
,sad,False,I 24 F have essentially been single forever. Had a high school boyfriend but nothing serious in adulthood. And to be clear- I’m not desperately seeking a relationship. It’s definitely something I desire but something genuine.
,sad,True,Family was strict growing up so when I became an adult they just expected me to know how to date out of nowhere. I didn’t start feeling this sad about it until ALL of my friends are in serious relationships.. I barely got to see them before and now almost never. I don’t feel that I’m ugly so maybe I’m just a late bloomer. And I know I shouldn’t compare myself but I’m now really feeling the loneliness .
,sad,False,"Not even exaggerating but everyone in my immediate circle (household,friends,even long distance friends) is in a committed relationship.  And not to sound cringe but I feel left out because I’m the ONLY single person I know so it makes me feel something is the problem with me. And I try to fake the funk like I’m completely happy but deep down I desire romance,love,companionship etc"
,sad,False,I
,confessions,False,"Hi everyone I'm 17M and I'm really attracted to my second aunt, she's so beautiful and actually a good person, she's kind and gentle. I know this is forbidden and this feeling is forbidden but I can't help myself, from the day I started feeling attracted to girls my eyes have been on her. I have never liked anyone else other than her. She's older than me. I need help and advice. I've tried fighting this but did not succeed. A part of me knows this is worng and a part of me wants something to happen between us and says this is not wrong ."
,depression,True,"For about a year now, life has had this grey undertone. I keep getting disappointed by things, I’ve learned to absolutely hate myself. No friends, I suck at being human and connecting with people. I’m a failure, I have off days where I just emotionally torture my mom cuz of how I feel. Grades are slipping, starting to not see a future for myself. All I do is sleep now. I gave myself a day to possibly do it if things don’t get better. Maybe I’m just a snowflake? 🤷‍♂️"
,depression,True,"My life seems so colorless. I don't know what to call it, but it eats away everything from you: you feel like you are constantly getting drained of emotion. I have lost my productivity, my love and don't know what to do. My friends and family don't care to understand: work, study become a better man. Feels like there is no way to escape because I don't even want to"
,depression,False,"Idk if its because of depression but my body is so weak. I feel sudden pain around my body. I'm thinking if i have a serious disease. I went to the doctor they're not super concern, did a physical exam to my body didn't find anything wrong. But i feel so weak. Sometimes im getting out of balance when i walk. My heart skips a beat. I'm underweight, im too consious what to eat coz I try to avoid unhealthy foods but i feel like im not nourishing my body. Idk where to go doctor doesnt take me seriously. Any insights can give me comfort."
,confessions,False,"So until today, I have not realized it this clearly; I actually come across as a very mean spirited, malicious bitch. I am a very empathetic person but because of bad experiences I had in the past, I have adapted this very cynical and nihilistic approach towards men and I come across so morally ambiguous that it keeps people curious but they never doubt that I’m a bad person. And the worst part is that I have ingrained this persona so deeply that I cannot act otherwise. I genuinely get the itch to tease and provoke men, just to get them to that boiling point where they also feel corrupt and then I laugh at their face about it. It’s literally a chore for me to be nice to a dude. They find me conventionally attractive and smart so that gives me an opportunity to almost always get away with this shit and when I don’t, I go lengths to prove them otherwise. It might sound like I’m already better than that since I am doubting it but I just believe that nothing can rid this approach off me. Rationally, I get that the world is shit as it is and provoking people and exploiting their vulnerabilities is the last thing we need, and that human relations are sacred and the most important thing we have but in practice, I fail to see any hope and it’s almost instinctive for me to do this over and over again while deep inside craving a genuine tender connection."
,confessions,True,Idk what life wants from me. I really just feel so trapped in a life that I don't want of care to have Anymore. I'm so ready to leave.
,confessions,False,this is coming from a 16 year old junior by the way and i’m tired of this cycle im going through this year.
,confessions,False,"because of my foot fetish, i used to masturbate at pictures of girls outfits and what I’m dealing with pays the price. I’m paranoid of making friends and how they’ll respond to me (i have a habit of taking things seriously for no reason). I see couples in school and people hanging out with each other and i feel jealous and anxious about it because i think i won’t have something like that when i wish i did. Like where did I go wrong?!? I had more friends when I was being a annoying idiot and now i barely talk to them."
,confessions,False,"oh and not to mention how I feel paranoid about people talking smack at me for being weird and I think they talk about me all the time, high school AND online."
,confessions,True,"I want to change my life and kill all of these feelings in my head. The lust addiction of objectifying girls, the social anxiety and insecurity like am I too late to better myself and make these 2 high school years + my future better and memorable?"
,confessions,False,"okay so this is kinda embarrassing to admit but whatever, its confessions so here we go."
,confessions,False,"ive been traveling solo for a while now and everyone back home thinks im this super brave, fearless girl who just takes off across the country without blinking. i guess i let them believe that because it sounds cooler than the truth."
,confessions,False,"the truth is half the time im terrified. i act like i know what im doing but im always one wrong turn away from crying in a parking lot. like yesterday, i checked into this hostel in nevada and immediately realized i had no idea how to talk to the group of people hanging out in the common area. i literally walked in, panicked, pretended i forgot something, and walked right back out. then i sat on my bunk scrolling my phone like i wasnt totally overwhelmed."
,confessions,True,"i also pretend that being away from my boyfriend is fine and good for us, but some nights i lie there wondering if im the one messing everything up by leaving for so long. i dont tell him im scared or lonely because i dont want him to worry or think i cant handle this."
,confessions,False,"the dumbest part? i post cute pics and little updates to make it look like im thriving. and sometimes i am, but not as consistently as i make it seem. i guess ive built up this image of myself that i feel like i have to keep performing."
,confessions,False,"idk, it just feels good to admit out loud that im not as put-together or adventurous as people think. im trying, but im definitely faking pieces of this as i go."
,confessions,False,Straight to the point being a 27yrs M software having a girlfriend in ofc and a clg girlfriend still in line (whom we havent meet after the clg ) in-mean  time in office im getting attached to this girl in office im in a dileamma like i still find it hard to detached from  the clg gf whom i getting into relationship immediately after my breakup someone correct me in a way to solve this or how to say her in a way she get less hurtful.
,depression,True,I feel so severely depressed. Have no one to talk. I dont even get tears anymore to cry. been crying since 8 months since my girlfriend left me.
,depression,False,she came out of a toxic relationship before and straight out jumped into me.
,depression,False,She showed show much emotion mentally and physically. i fell for it. then.....
,depression,False,"Boommmm she left like it nothing happened between us. because ""she couldn't emotionally get out her previous toxic relationship"". I was in a dark place crying waiting for her to be back for 8 months. i drank fell down and broke my meniscus and ACL."
,depression,False,as you know about acl recovery its very long and tough. i have to depend on everybody. she didn't even check on me during and after surgery. I feel like i am a burden to everybody. i dont have anybody.
,depression,True,i am currently doing my master thesis. focusing on everything all at once is very frustrating exhausting draining. I am done with this life
,depression,True,"I haven't slept. I'm desperate to talk to anyone right now. I'm on my last straw. I am completely worthless and there's no point to my existence. I'm just everyone's emotional punching bag. I am a failure and there's nothing useful about my existence. Every time anyone talks about Me and my siblings they have so much to say about the perfect sons but when it comes to me I'm just ""pretty"" now. I'm not pretty without my makeup so there are no good qualities that anyone can name. And I know for a fact that I'm not pretty because I was bullied for my awful face. People also treat you differently when you're ugly. My mother took my makeup as well so I've had to go everywhere without it. I feel completely disgusting. People have been staring at my bare face and it makes my self esteem drop even lower. Especially when I'm around family. They stare at me for a while now since I have no makeup and they don't comment on my face like they usually do when I have makeup on. I am aware that I am not attractive but it would be nice if people didn't make it so obvious. Before I got my stuff taken, I made an account and it blew up. Four of my videos went viral and everyone in my comments were saying how I was pretty with my makeup and I felt so much better. But since my mother took my phone, I haven't been able to post in 2 weeks. I feel so low right now. I hope I'm not losing followers. I had 14.9K. I was actually able to achieve something and felt good about it since I was useless for everything else and she took it from me. I just want someone to talk to so I'm not alone anymore. I've been alone all my life."
,depression,True,"But while he was lecturing me I completely lost my cool and started screaming at the top of my lungs and hyperventilating. I fell to the floor and my vision was blurry and all I hear is him telling me to breathe which aggravated me further. Sometimes after my mother called me to her room and started lecturing me and I couldn't take anymore lectures on how I was a horrible child and their lives were harder so I just kind of stood there zoned out. She saw my scars and said ""You're just like your father. You're dramatic. You're bipolar. You're mentally I'll"". After that I completely stopped listening. She let my brothers go through my messages and they would make fun of me every single day. They would bully me nonstop. Even at family gatherings they would bully me and other family members noticed but my mothers excuse was ""They're boys, they're just messing with her"". I spent 4 entire days crying. Even at school. Some teachers tried to help but i just told them I was fine. I couldn't make myself stop crying. My 17th birthday was forgotten. I spent it completely alone, watching everyone else that was my age drive cars and get jobs and save up for college or an apartment. My grades were poor. I had no money. I was a helpless 17 year old. My grades are still poor. I'm homeschooled. I can't bring myself to raise them. I'm so far behind everyone else. I don't understand what the teachers are teaching anymore. I'm still doing all of the chores by myself. Cleaning after her two sons that are in their 20's. Still getting my stuff taken as an adult. There's nothing I can do because I have no where else to live. Yesterday I was supposed to get all of my stuff back but she changed her mind and said I ""wasn't trying"" with my school work. I raised my grades from all 0s but i couldn't raise them too much higher in the span of 5 days. Right now I'm on my computer sobbing and typing. I've never felt this low before. I've been crying all night."
,confessions,False,"I want to change my life and kill all of these feelings in my head. The lust addiction of objectifying girls, the social anxiety and insecurity, like am I too late to better myself and make these 2 high school years + my future better and memorable? I don’t wanna hurt anybody or push the people who care about me away and hide myself from that, and I want to be more interactive, actually funny and cool and not a freaky ass dude like what do I do?"
,depression,True,"There are days when I feel good like genuinely good and alive, talking to people, laughing, feeling like I’m part of something again. And then out of nowhere something just hits me and it’s like I completely lose my balance on life. I don’t even know how to be a human all of a sudden. Whenever I’m having a good time it starts to feel like I’m just escaping while the “real” world is chasing me with the pressure about my career, my future, all the things I’m supposed to be dealing with."
,depression,False,"And when that switch flips, I just shut down. I pull away from plans, from people, from classes, even from just walking outside. I feel like absolute shit again, and the worst part is I never see it coming."
,depression,True,"I’ve tried journaling, but even that messes with me. I’ll write something honest and immediately judge myself for it. Like, “seriously? This is what you’re upset about? Other people have real problems. Yours don’t even count.” It’s like I have this internal version of myself constantly watching me and shaking their head, telling me I should be doing more, trying harder."
,depression,True,"But I am trying. I actually am. I started a course this October after two years of feeling stuck and I’m looking for internships already. I’m pushing myself to talk to people again. Joined Yoga, moved to a whole new country and started building a life. But it all feels so fragile, like any moment it could just disappear and I’ll be back to that useless, empty version of myself I’m terrified of becoming again."
,depression,False,I don’t know why this keeps happening and more often than before
,depression,True,"My depression feels like a physical barrier. I’ll be happy for the day then suddenly the glass wall falls in between me and the rest of the world. All I can do is look through and watch what usually makes me happy, but I can’t interact with it. I can’t feel the happiness that’s on the outside. No one understands when I tell them that everything I think about fills me with dread."
,depression,True,"I’m not always like this, I actually don’t know if I’ve exactly felt this way before. It’s just felt really miserable lately, maybe starting 2 months ago. I’m not “mentally” better than I’ve ever been, I haven’t had suicidal or self harm ideations in years now. I want to do things that make me happy all day, I have so much that makes me fulfilled but I can’t get my body to do them. It’s like something deep in my body is sad. Down to my bones. The only thing that makes me upset is this frustrating inability to be happy and do things. I don’t think I’ve felt this debilitated in my life. Even at my worst I had shit I relied on to distract me all day."
,depression,True,"It’s so awful to tell my fiance every day that I suddenly feel sad. He blames himself and it must weigh on him a lot to carry me every day, when I don’t even want him to. But I don’t really know what to do."
,depression,True,"I feel as though it’s definitely medication changes I’ve had over the last few months, we just keep experimenting with new things because I’m resistant to many meds, but when it’s suddenly so bad it’s daunting that I need to go through all the steps to get off of and change medications just for it to maybe work. Maybe make it worse. Doesn’t help that appointments are made farther out right now."
,depression,False,"Some bullshit that definitely isn’t helping is that I suffer from an undiagnosed untreatable chronic pain in my chest that persists every second of the day, almost 5 years now. Whole other fucking story."
,depression,True,I’m just sad. But I don’t want to be. It feels completely inescapable and I don’t get any closer to the light at the end of the tunnel no matter how much I walk. I know it’s there and things will get better but it’s just a distant view right now.
,depression,False,"Thanks if anyone read my dumb vent lol. I try not to burden anyone with this more than I already do, so there’s hardly anyone I talk to about this."
,depression,False,TDLR at bottom bc nobody ever fucking engages when I post anything longer than a paragraph and I need support.
,depression,False,"I have been so sad for as long as I can remember, I've blocked most of my life out esp childhood but my grandma told me the first time I complained of ""looking happy outside but not feeling happy inside"" I was FOUR. I am literally just a result of generational trauma. I was born broken."
,depression,True,"I struggle so hard to compliment myself so writing this and POSTING it is difficult but god damn I have not ever met another person like me. I empathize with everyone even when they seriously don't deserve it. I give so much grace, I care so much more about my loved ones problems than they even do themselves. Im nowhere near perfect but I always take accountability for my faults and never have that same thing returned. I am such a good friend to have around and people keep projecting their shit behaviors on to me including my own mother, who I'm no contact with now."
,depression,True,"I am so tired of being the villain. At this point I wish I could be but I can't. I care way too much and I'm naive. This world and the people in it have not created a space for someone as empathetic and sensitive as I am. I've been chewed up and spit out, I made an already bad situation worse by making shitty decisions because I have NO self worth. So more trauma on top of childhood trauma and negative core beliefs and despite trying so hard to get better, things don't ever change, and I can't climb out of the hole I dug trying to bury all the pain."
,depression,False,TLDR; why am I so empathetic and caring but never cared for? Why am I always made to be the bad guy in every situation when I am blatantly NOT? Why do I feel so alienated for being a good person when shitty people have tons of friends?
,depression,True,"The only reason I'm alive is because if I die, it would hurt my mom. When she dies, I'm planning to just end it. Every year that I get older, life gets worse. I'm ugly, never went on a date, still a virgin, work a trashy job, have autism, no friends or girlfriend. I started strength training, eating clean 4 months ago but I'm still depressed. There is no hope for me. Just suffering. Dont know what to do anymore."
,depression,True,"I have tried most SSRIs and all snris and all have felt like sugar pills, I have also tried multiple antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, benzos etc. The next step is probably going to be tricyclics and I'm wondering if anyone here is taking them, and if they have helped you, thanks."
,depression,True,"If i walk around, i get called nonchalant. I talk to the opposite gender, rumours goes out. I speak, I get shut down. I work, and be made fun of because my low marks. Every single time, i just want to be me, but i cant. I talk plently because I havent gotten to talk to people much, as i just dont wanna be around people. I get treated wrong (ghosted, and hated). Im the punching bag in the group, made for insults (like what, am i gonna hold it and keep it up. bro people expect too much of me). I lowkey just want it to end already."
,confessions,False,"So my ex-bf (36) told me his mom passed, but I can't find deat records...it says she is living (at 79yo) in one of two houses, one is a two family house where she lived on one side and he on the other. I knew she stayed there up until her deat, but it says shes still living there or at a previous address."
,confessions,True,"I probs shouldnt care, but he told me this sob story of having to hold her hand when saying goodbye to her by pulling the plug, she had cancer I think."
,confessions,False,We also had sex there once and he was fine with me making noises. Just curious.
,confessions,False,I am just curious if that is true. Did something more sinister happen?
,confessions,False,"While he is my ex, and yes I am looking into him and trying to find shit on him...he is genuinely a skeevy guy looking back on it. So I wouldnt be surprised if he ""psycho'd"" his mom. hahah"
,depression,True,i cant keep my hygiene anymore
,depression,True,I’m never seeing the woman I love again. She doesn’t feel as I do anymore.
,depression,True,I can’t get a full time job in my field. I have student debt I can’t pay off.
,depression,True,My family hates me. I’m a parasite to them. I’m isolated in their basement until they kick me out.
,depression,True,I barely even talk to anyone online anymore. I’m a complete recluse.
,depression,True,I don’t want to die but I feel like my life has no purpose anymore. Nothing left to do but waste away.
,depression,True,ive been trying to reach out to people esp friends but its like they dont want to talk about it? maybe they dont know the right things to say but people dont check up on me either???
,depression,True,"i once went to the a&e bc i was having extremely bad chest pains and wasnt sure if i was having an anxiety attack or heart problem. i texted my friend and she just responded with a gws! and went on and on about her work. another recent instance was when i was very down at work and was actually thinking of ways to off myself. i wasnt actually gonna do anyth, but i felt like i was so overwhelmed with unhappiness i js felt like i didnt want to be alive anymore. she just kept going on and on and on about this guy that shes interested at work. genuinely js wondering what is wrong w my friends or isit my fault for gg to them expecting a better form of response."
,depression,False,"maybe this whole journey is just meant to be lonely and people inherently js dgaf abt me. im not sure what kind of concern i am expecting from people, but i think sharing and exposing myself made me feel even lonelier."
,confessions,False,With a shitshow of stupidity and injustice which is what our world is today...well I kinda thought of an idea to feed pesticides to the insects. I mean locusts or killer hornets and other similar. Just a thought thou that gets me all excited
,confessions,False,Kinda scary if u think about it for longer than few seconds.
,depression,True,I lost the feeling of everything I just feel my life is waiting to death
,depression,False,"So, for some time now I have been feeling a little depressed. I get into nothing and sometimes I hate everyone around me. Furthermore, I don't wash much (I only shower once a week and I don't really brush my teeth). However, sometimes I clean my room, I eat quite often and with my friends I'm even a little sociable! I don't know if I'm depressed or not and I would like your help or at least an answer to my question. Thank you in advance"
,depression,True,21-m.
,depression,True,"Ive had a family member become disabled where I had to take care of them for a few years, ive gotten into a car accident while under the influence that almost killed me and my old friends, and my head was so fucked from the drugs and the guilt kicked me enough to fix the car up out of pocket, and lost my job due to that as well. (no dui got out of there)"
,depression,True,"These events were a few years ago but everything just keeps getting louder whenever im alone. Ive wasted the last 3 years of my life doing jack shit and rotting away at home, job hunting was damn near impossible and when I did land the job my mind simply just sees it as ""go back in your comfortzone"", where i quit the same week or even a few shifts after."
,depression,True,"Im still living at home with my family and taking some online courses for college, I  simply just feel like im a worthless sad sack of shit that would never amount to anything. Whenever im alone or its dead silent at night I just constantly have the thoughts blowing my brains out or simply disappearing completely from everything but I cant do that to : my family, a few friends and a life that I havent fully lived would all be gone to waste. Insomnia, eating disorder, past substance abuse, ruined relationships and the fact that I might be bipolar or some shit( never been diagnosed but had a single session with a therapist where from her professional viewpoint sees me as a high functioning person with very severe depression) Ive confided with my family a few times, a select few friends while high as shit(I fucking regret it) and occasionally vent out to chatgpt lol."
,depression,True,"Not sure what to do with my life, future living expenses seems like id be stuck like this for the rest of my life. Im simply just stuck existing in this environment where none other than myself have caused all of this. I want to feel something I really do but I dont, contantly ruminating about bad experiences or shitty people ive come across in my life. I guess in a sense im fearful of being like this but at the same time im ok with how it is now."
,depression,False,"im a very weak dude, i can't defend myself, i can't take too much pain, always scared to start a confrontation, always nervous about other ppl watching and get nervous on stuff like stage performance ,can't drive too nice, i cry and literally can't argue back and just say sorry if someone in my school bullies me or is being rude to me, I'm not very street smart and have always been the friend which ppl ditch for other ppl always and hence usually have no friends and no status or respect among boys anywhere now I'm not tryna do a self pity kinda thing, it's just the way I am and I wanna get better so bad but i literally can't, it seems like I'm being attached from everywhere with nowhere to escape, if I can't protect my own self how tf would I ever have a gf, and i don't think i deserve girls too tbh lmao, I'm at absolute bottom of my life pls help me I'm surrounded by issues everywhere"
,confessions,True,"I posted myself on an exposure site wearing my wife's white stockings and leopard print nightie. People who see it can extend the time and it's now almost 4 days and I hope it will expire. 162 strangers have seen me. It's exciting but also scary. I promise myself I won't do it again, but always go back. The current picture will be up for at least 4 days. Friends and family would be ashamed of me. I guess I have always been somewhat into exposure/humiliation from early on and I don't know what caused it. To be seen not only vulnerable, but in a compromising way is somehow a turn on."
,depression,True,"I, 16F have struggled from age 10- present with depression. I get into these depressive states where I feel as if I am floating aimlessly with no purpose. I thought I was getting better, id volunteer every week, id study and complete assignments vigorously. Id do everything in my power to prepare for the future, good habits, connections, social skills, weightlifting. I founded an indigenous student council within my school, I was an advocate, passionate about life. i wanted to be a Firefighter, to do something more than myself, to put my life on the line for others, to be selfless."
,depression,True,"For a while that was my purpose. But then one day something broke, and I started getting worse mentally, I started to seclude myself from others, isolate myself from anyone who even showed a glimmer of affection, or that they cared. I stopped finding purpose in doing assignments, or even doing mundane things like cleaning my room, brushing my teeth, or showering. I mean, if I cant see a future for myself, what's the point in all of this preparation? Almost every night I sit by my door, and hear my parents talk about how I don't reach for the helping hand, how im unmotivated, lazy, and how I have so much potential. I spend my days and nights letting time pass by, while I pray to a god I don't even know if I believe in, its just that glimmer of hope that, something other than me will be able to reverse all of this. I started falling into my bad habits again, to relive my mind from all of my nasty disgusting thoughts. I've lost my best friend last month due to her saying I am the most disgusting, vile, and horrible person they've ever met. I've started anti deppressants last week, i've been getting a little more motivation to get out of bed and  atleast eat. I don't want to live like this, every day I wake up feeling like a shitty, horrible, unmotivated person. My parents are right, I know I have more potential."
,depression,False,"I honestly don't know how to move up from here, i've hit rock bottom atleast 10 times these last two months."
,depression,True,"16M. I keep trying to off myself, but i can't. I dont have any friends here, nobody willing to take me seriously. I dont have any relationships, no besties, nothing. I look normal, have a normal personality, act like a fucking normal person, but I'm fucking going insane. How normal do i have to be?? I feel alone every moment of the day. My family doesn't give a shit about me, my classmates dont give a shit about me, nobody cares. I'm shit at studying, shit at sports, and the only reason people talk to me is if they want something from me, which nobody does. I get bullied because I game and like to play games, any game. I get bullied because I'm Indian, short, dark. I just haven't done it because im afraid of dying, scared of pain. But i might do it, because i fucking hate my miserable life more than anything. Meds dont help. Therapy doesn't help. Nothing does. I just want the pain to go away...."
,depression,False,Ok so this is a bit much (I say that and it’s gonna end up not being a lot). It’s just I know I have a loving family and all. I love them too I rlly do but I have like no true friends. Like sure at school there are some kids that talk to me but none of them are true friends there just school friends. And I go to a small school so it’s not like I can just go ok to someone I’ve never met cuz there no one I’ve never met. And like I know this is gonna sound cringe but it’s like everyone comes to me for help like wether it’s about a friendship or anything really and I’ve got no one to go to and I never have. It’s like I’m used to it and you would think like “oh you probably feel so much weight ect” but I really don’t cuz I’ve become numb to it or wtvr and that’s fine really it’s just I wish I had someone. Like I’ve always been a nobody like when ppl talk to me it’s mostly just for hep they never talk about really anything else. And like idk im not suicidal or anything cuz I could never do that ik ive got a life ahead of me yada yada. But anyway yea its just I dunno I have no one to talk to. I’ve been pouring out of an empty cup for a long time and yet it works and I’m still able to help the ppl that come to me. I honestly am not even sure who I would be anymore if I stopped helping ppl cuz that’s just who I’ve become. I’m not even sure if I would want to change if given then opportunity if I’m being honest just cuz I like helping ppl. My life is really worth nothing let’s be real here so I’ve got nothing to lose be helping ppl and being hurt in the process. I’ve had to sadly mature faster than the rest of my age group (Ik I shouldn’t share my age online and any predators that clicked on this just to try and get a minor f you) sorry anyway no one my age really gets me anymore just because I’m more mature and grown up then them and I hate it cuz I want someone my age that will get me but I know that’ll never happen. Yes I have tried to “open up” or wtvr and I was met with “not everything is about you” so yea. I think that’s everything so yea. Idrc if people decide to hate in the comments if anyone even decides to comment for some reason cuz theres nothing you can say that hasn’t been said to me before. Sorry if I did something wrong this is my fist time opening up and my first time posting something on Reddit.
,confessions,False,"Hi everyone I did post here today but I removed it I'm sorry but I have a genuine thing to confess. I am attracted to my second aunt. I'm 17M. I know it's wrong but I just can't help myself, she's so beautiful and nice. A part of me knows it's wrong but a part of me says it's fine and this part of me actually desires a relationship with her. Well I need advice and help. I've tried to fight this feeling but it's just gotten stronger. I've liked her since I could feel attraction towards women and this is not me fantasizing about her(I don't watch porn). Thank you for reading this."
,confessions,False,"How much older? Let's say I was born in the time of Beyonce rise to Fame and he was born when David Bowie was rising to Fame. Now did I know that? Yes, absolutely but I didn't fully comprehend this wasn't just some fantasy but reality."
,confessions,False,"I've only seriously dated shorter men. I'm 5'8 and they are usually 5'4/5'5. I don't care about thier height , I'm more focused on myself and by the time I do. Well I'm already dating them for some time."
,confessions,False,Now what makes this encounter with my older ex hilarious is the fact he ghosted me over a year ago now. Dropped off the map because he didn't want to apologize for being horrible.
,confessions,False,"I saw him while shopping at the mall. I just recognized his face and respectfully turned my head away. I thought OHH it's you , well okay."
,confessions,False,"He looked at me in sheer horror while I standing there with my friends. He pushed haphazardly through the crowded courtyard, I don't know...he just looked like a funny grumpy old man. By the time he was halfway near the entrance he started running at full speed .I whispered to myself...don't break a hip! I honestly have no clue as to why he was running. I've seen him many times , never have I talked to him or acknowledged him ."
,confessions,True,"cw: suicide, sh"
,confessions,True,"Hi, first time post and probably my only. I'm currently in a different situation in my relationship. I 19(M) and my boyfriend 21 (M) have been in a rocky place in our relationship as of late. For some context right before we met i had gotten out of my first long term relationshi, that really fucked me up + lots of family issues and my declining mental health. I turned to some poor coping habits. I was at a really hard place. My current boyfriend and I when we were first talking spent a lot of time sharing our past relationships and experience. Our struggles in them, what we miss, where things went wrong and how we behave in relationships. I was super hesitant to start another relationship since I was really in no place to get hurt again. My boyfriend assured me he would be the best relationship I've ever had. Now I wouldn't disagree with that statement, this has also been the most diff and emotionally taxing experience in my life. My boyfriend has a long history of mental illness, it's something that weighs on him all the time. We have had many conversations about him applying for assisted suicide due to this. Going into this relationship I knew he had struggled much more than me. I figured that since he was older and had much more resources to help cope he had a fairly good grip on it all. The biggest issue really isn't just the hard nights when i'm having to clean up his arms or he's screaming at me over how much pain he's in. Which this all might sound genuinely so stupid and selfish, but because he struggles so much I often have to take on all the chores of the house, taking him to appointment, trying to get him out of bed and making sure he's at least eating once or twice a day. In the beginning it was only every once in a while things would get bad for a night and then he'd be mostly functional again. In the last few months he's been isolating, not communicating what he's going through and withdrawing from me in a lot of ways. He doesn't ask me about my day, interrupts me, etc. He's constantly asking me to do chores and when they aren't done he gets frustrated and sometimes upset with me for it. I personally love doing acts of service for people, Its a big part of who I am. I've been told my biggest flaw in life is letting people use and walk over me. Never standing up for myself, I'm a bit better with standing my ground nowadays but I'm still giving so much of myself to him with very little in return. I lost my closest friendship when we first got together, and a few others while we have been together. I've almost lost most of my friends due to having to be so involved in his life. Many times i feel like i've lost myself fully. I can't go out without having to check my phone 24/7 because often i have to leave early to tend to his needs. Part of the reason i quit my last job was that i had to last second drive and hour to pick him up so he didn't run himself off the road, my boss was pissed. I know again this all sounds so selfish , but i also have a lot of struggles with my mental health, he's got family, friends and therapists to talk to, i have 2 friends other than him, and i only hear from them once every month. Everyone else is sick of me talking about my relationship issues. I've built up some resentment towards him, which i hate. I just can't keep giving so much of myself. For months i can't sleep and im crying anytime im alone. I love this boy more than anything, and i genuinely can't see my life where he's not in it. I deeply want him to be my person. I just wish i got even a little bit of that effort in return, sometimes i see him doing things for his friends, listening to their problems and talking it out. it makes me sad and honestly really jealous, most of the time when i bring up my struggles to him he tells me i need to see a therapist. About a month ago things got really bad for me, and i relapsed a year into my streak for sh. When i told him about it he didn't say sorry, just asked if i used his stuff to do it and if it was his fault. I haven't felt this alone in so long. Many of those things he promised me he could be in the beginning he hasn't followed through on. He's never made me handmade gifts, or written me a letter. I put it together that i was more likely to get his suicide more than a love letter from him. I miss the boy i fell in love with. My life is so deeply rooted in his, I can't leave, I have no other home and i can't afford to live alone at the moment, especially with school. Now yes of course I've communicated these things, the last big conversation we had about this i told him if he can't give me anything in return I can't stay with him. He basically responded with ""if i do that im going to end it"" and i don't know what to do about that. I can't emotionally handle having his life in my hands. I can't keep living like this, i spend everyday in bed rotting my youth away and it's ruining me. I've been trying to branch out and work on my own life. Tonight though things were rough. I feel like im going crazy, I don't have anyone to talk to about this and have found nothing online to give me anything relief in my situation. I don't think i'm asking for too much, I can be kinda clingy at times. Which i get can be annoying , especially since i don't have many other people to talk to outside of him. He's asked me in the past to be kinder to him and that his friends don't think i actuallt like him, I can be a bit bratty and nitpicky from time to time. I've worked on this behavior and it hasn't been much of an issue. I've had conversations with him about the way he talks to me (not talking to me like a maid) or not being rude for chores not being done. I was again told that he can't offer me anything more than he is currently. I truely don't know if i should stay, i'm scared everyday im going to come home and he's going to be gone. Or that every fight we get in or goodbye will be our last. I've dealt with suicidal family members since i was 13, I've been put as someone's lifeline before. This though is so much. I just want to be happy, I don't want to ruin my life wasting away over him 24/7. I want to be able to figure out who I am. But I can't leave him like this, and I have no one to turn to anymore."
,confessions,True,Im sorry this is probably so out of order and honestly might be the worst thing i've ever said. but im losing my mind here
,depression,True,Made a post here some weeks ago. No response. Normal reaction to my awesomeness. I really want to end my life. I'm researching methods today. I'm not afraid. But I'm scared they might fail. Fail much like the failure I am. Hopefully I find something I can use at home. Why make another post? Idk. Maybe my family sees this if they can unlock my phone.
,depression,True,"If it wasn't for my parents i would have probably already killed myself. Up to a week ago i would have probably even included some of my closest friends, but I am starting to doubt they even see me as one. I'm 17, i got a whole life in front of me but I alredy want it to end. Solitude is eating me from the inside out and I feel emptier every day, i just wish i wasnt born into this world."
,depression,False,Bye bye to this world with a can of soda and saftey pin
,confessions,False,"I, 36/F, don't know if it's me or my mental health but I'm not sure I want to be with my partner anymore 50/M. We've been together for almost 4 years and this is my longest relationship which before only clocked at a year. He's a wonderful man, he is a sweet, calm, solid and consistent rock of a person. I love him so much. My problem? I OBSSESS OVER SEX. Its the ADHD and anxiety in me. I've been like this since I was a young kid, I just never told anyone.   The moment I'm not working and back home, I start wanting it. And for him, he's practically asexual when it comes to sex.  He never makes the first move for sex. I've cried and told him how feel but it's like he thinks it's a joke or he gets sad, holds me, falls asleep... And im left feeling just as sad and empty but now angry as well now bc it feels like a copput.   I'm not an angry sex person, I'm a sad sex person and I'm sad all the time now. I got good on mental health meds right before I met him which dropped my libido a lot but now... Maybe my body is used to it."
,confessions,False,"Also with being adhd, I can make rash decisions spontaneously.   My mom says I should just learn to communicate better with him and work on it, but I feel like an old married couple already. No morning sex tries, no any time sex tries. I've also been thinking of the 5 year plan. Like maybe I build my career and write my books so I can sell them and make money and if I can build my account, then I can afford a place like we have together, but on my own. I could not even think affording the house we live in rn without him that has a yard for my dogs and so nice and private. On top of that, I started flirting with an old fling that lives states away. No cheating just flirting on snap. I'd never cheat on him, I just feel like he doesn't desire me. He loves me tho..."
,confessions,False,A few years ago I was on vacation staying in a very high class resort. It was a normal vacation but while we were there I saw a few celebrities. I was there for a few weeks and after the first week I saw that Nicki Minaj had a suite right next to mine. A few times at night I even saw her naked on the balcony which was just surreal. During nights you could clearly hear that she was having sex. It always was very interesting to see her around during the days. That vacation probably is the best experience I ever had.
,confessions,False,"Started dating my bf 33M a year ago, after pushing him to make things official for 4 months. We were doing everything as a couple, it just wasn’t official. I got bored and decided to get on tinder and find other dates since he didn’t seem serious. He found out about it, wasn’t happy with it so he went and sex with a girl he had been having sex with at the same period of time we started talking. I only found out about this girl through a mutual friend months later into our relationship and that’s when he admitted he had sex with someone else when I decided to meet the guy from tinder. We forgave each other and 6 months later I found texts on his phone, he was flirting with two different girls, had invited both of them to his apartment, he was at their apartment several times, I broke up with him but he convinced me to forgive him saying he never had sex with them, it was just flirting. I took him back but I didn’t forgive him. A week ago I went out for drinks with a gf and I met a guy at the bar and we ended up going to his house, made out but we didn’t have sex. This relationship already feels exhausting I have tried talking to him about breaking up but every time he says we shouldn’t break up and these are things couples face. At the moment he is on a business trip, I don’t trust that he won’t cheat because he has a lot of girls he used to hook up with whenever he traveled for work, but now we are together he says he won’t contact any of his previous hook ups. Should I trust him or not? I talked to him today and he made a joke saying his dick is wondering why he has not had sex on a business trip, that he is holding myself from getting back to his old behavior because he is now in a relationship with him.( I haven’t told him I cheated on him last week, is he finds out he will definitely do it as well)"
,depression,False,"Every single day, I wake up without having a goal or something to accomplish. I'm not interested in anything. Sure, I do a lot of stuff, like writing and drawing, but I never finish any of my projects. I want to finish them, but I get repulsed by my own techniques and quit midway."
,depression,False,"At school, I just pass through. I'm pleased with my mediocrity, never achieving the top or bottom of the class. I don't study. My motivation is non-existent. I try, but then I end up with a mistake that overthrows my desire to pass indifference."
,depression,False,"I'm lonely and not content with the people around me. Everyone seems either too monotone or fake. I do hang out with some acquaintances at school so people won't think I'm a loser. We don't usually go places or text, just talk between breaks. Outside of that, I'm pretty much on my own. I see a lot of dudes who I want to befriend, but then I'll look desperate if I chat first."
,depression,True,"Currently, the only target I have is to not die, and even that is questionable. Everything is a mess, and I got comfortable to live around it. Been doing whatever this is since 2 years ago. My time passes with me waking up, going to school, coming home, doing something forgettable, and sleeping. I can't see myself in a few years. I'm not aware of what I'm going to do in the future. If anything, I'll just let my life progress and end up somewhere with the same attitude."

,confessions,True,"I am a pathological liar. I’ve been a liar my whole life, and I don’t know why. I’ve never experienced anything traumatic, I come from a pretty well off background (my parents are educated, both still happily married to each other, own multiple properties, good sibling relationship) I’ve never been bullied, I’m pretty popular and quite good looking if I say so myself.  The only ‘bad’ part about my life is that I live with a chronic illness. Another thing is that about ten years ago my mother went through a phase of postpartum depression which developed into postpartum psychosis and eventually a full mental breakdown- she recovered but I still feel like it takes a toll on me to think about it, especially as recently I know she has been struggling with her mental health and was turning to self h@rm to cope. But it’s alright and my family are supporting her through it and she’s doing a lot better."

,confessions,False,"When I say I have an addictive personality, I don’t just mean substances I also mean like I develop obsessions with people. Any past relationship I’ve ever had has become extremely toxic for the other person because I become possessive and stalkerish. And also in terms of friendships I can become obsessive."
,confessions,True,"I want to stop lying, I want to stop drugs, I want to be normal. But I feel like I’m trapped and I can’t stop. I have tried to stop lying but for some reason when I try and correct myself after telling a lie the words won’t come out, in terms of the drugs I feel isolated without them. Due to my chronic illness I can’t drink alcohol without it putting me through excruciating pain, so when it comes to parties and things I turn to drugs so as to ‘fit in’."
,confessions,False,I don’t want to be like this and I don’t know where to turn. I feel like I can’t tell my parents as they have enough on their plate already and I just don’t know what to do really?
,confessions,False,"There is gaming laptop I really want, it has been years of me very much yearning for it however the price is ridiculously expensive. So I plan on going to buy abroad for a much cheaper option since it's expensive in where I live. The issue happened is where my friend (same age) also wanting to buy a gaming laptop told me that she would also like the model I am buying abroad since it's cheaper, let's call her Amy."
,confessions,False,"But one day Amy went to our other friend's house, let's call her Sam. Amy went to Sam's house sparked a conversation with her brother about gaming laptops and recommends since Sam's brother is also a gamer. But turns out Sam's brother's friend has a gaming laptop used for like three times because he switched to pc, so he is selling that gaming laptop for a ridiculously cheap price. And it turned out to be my dream gaming laptop. I didn't know about this conversation until like 30 minutes later after it all happened, Amy is buying it and I feel absolutely horrible ever since I found that out. I cried alot that day because I was this close to getting it. Mind you neither Sam or Amy know that this is the dream model I've been wanting for years. I couldn't keep it in and told Sam about it and she immediately apologized, saying she would have told if she knew sooner. It's neither their fault but I feel absolutely horrible. Very bad negative thoughts about it something like ""Amy researched it for just a month and she gets it instead??? Even when I researched it for years?? She doesn't deserve it"" or things like ""it's not fair I hope something bad happens to it"" mind you Amy and I are very good close friends.  We have great communication. But you know when you want something so bad and it was just right there until it got taken by someone else? That's how I feel. I feel guilty, and absolutely horrible. I am always happy when my friends receive things in life especially when it comes to things they want. However in this situation I don't think I can ever be happy for Amy in regards to the laptop I feel so much resentment, hate and anger. I still cry as of now due to the laptop, and then me being an asshole. Any opinions will help me, to navigate my feelings and their honest input about this."

I would sit in the back, and I would always end up looking at him from time to time. The next year, everyone learned one day that he had killed himself. Now I think about him all the time. Maybe I could’ve talked to him. I probably was the aware of what it feels like to be stuck in that pit, and what it does to someone. My advice to anyone who wants to die: Find the person you keep looking at during your day. Chances are, they want the same thing you do. It doesn’t matter what they look like, or how they act. Just sit with them. Maybe you can both go outside together. Maybe you can start a garden, or sign up for a doubles tennis tournament. The point is, you won’t be dead, and neither will they."

,depression,True,"I've never been feeling this low in my life until the last few months. For some context I'm 21, I've had a part time internship job since I was 18. I'm studying engineering in college. I did great first year and then since that point I've been failing and barely staying in the program. I have lost and gained back and forth around 70 pounds, my sleep has been scattered and I've been treating my friends and family like shit. Usually I noticed I would have these weeks where I was good and then I would have weeks where I wasn't and these phases past. But recently I've just been in. A downward spiral that doesn't stop. I've stopped caring for my work and sont attend I stopped going to classes I'm not studying for exams I lay in bed in my room which is the messiest it's ever been. I used to care about my car and now it's a mess junk garbage all over it . I didn't send in the bill to pay my tuition just because I didn't care for it and the interest added up on that. Ideveloped this apathy where I'm not caring about anything but it's my soul telling me I need to fix myself. I lost family recently and was given the horrible news and just had no reaction I just did meh and continued my day, and I do care for this person. I don't play video games anymore I don't play sports anymore and everytime I go to do something to see if it helps I just hate it and don't care for it. Idk what's wrong with me I had all my blood work done, I had virtually every supplement that should help and yet everyday gets worse and worse. Im pissed because on paper I should have to world by its balls and yet I'm a depressed loser who has no reason to be depressed. I would have given everything up if it wasn't for the fact I fear god. Im just tired, seriously just tired of everything and I don't want to live the rest of my life like this. I've tried talking about it with friends and family and a therapist and none of the strategies they gave help. I tried getting physical in the gym in sports and I just don't care for it after the first time I do it."
,depression,False,"I'm sorry for the rant I just am so lost now. I don't want to live like this, this I know. If anyone has advice please please let me know. Thanks in advance"
,depression,True,I can feel it. I can feel that feeling creeping up my spine telling me just let go. Let go and your pain will go away It will go on to others. Do I care if other are sad when I die no. They didn’t care when i was here they didn’t care at all. You can give me advice and I can tell you don’t waste your words. I’m to tired I’m to defeated to weak to slow to fight with you why i should live. I’ve been unemployed for 2 years im watching everyone who’s worse than me live wonderful lives. I’m watching my younger brother and sister get the parents I deserve. they get all the opportunities i was told I wasn’t good enough for.
,depression,True,i can change my way of thinking and I can assure you it won’t make a difference.  You can tell me you’re sorry I’m going through this but that doesn’t change anything. I don’t need attention from random people I just need someone to know.know that I am sorry I’m not the man i should be I’m sorry I changed so much you don’t know who I am anymore. I’m sorry I didn’t tell anyone sooner how much pain I was in I just knew you wouldn’t care till it was too late.don’t stand up and tell me how good of man I was when you never spent time with me. There’s no saving me there’s no reason to save me. I’ll be this way forever. Useless nothing.
,depression,False,"Apologies, this is going to be a little disjointed."
,depression,True,"I feel like my life is this weird dream. I'm trying to get somewhere and I don't know why, but it's incredibly important. And I keep running into people that tell me they would love to help me on my journey. And as soon as I get to trust them and rely on them for the journey, they shoot me. But not with anything lethal, just a crushing blow like a giant bean bag round to the chest. And eventually I'm just so fucking scared of people, because they're just slowly killing me. The injury over injury over injury over injury, just takes its toll."
,depression,False,Anybody else feel like that?
,depression,False,hey this is my first time on reddit i really dont know how to use it . i feel like suiciding i dont havae anyone to talk to . please give me a talk . i really need that . i am a 18 male so anyone please give me a talk i think i cant go this full night
,confessions,True,My earliest memory from when I was younger was physically and emotionally abusing others. I would physically beat close friends and say things in a blatant attempt to hurt them. I can’t think of a motive for these actions. Physical violence was short lived as most of this violence came when I was young (7 years old maybe).
,confessions,False,"later on in life towards middle school I would emotionally abuse close friends. Mentally torturing them because it felt really good to me. I would insult them, destroy physical items they cherished because I wanted to see them cry. I would feel no remorse (that I can remember) for these actions unless I was in trouble by an adult. Some friends would get it worse than others, as in middle school I had a friend who I would make it my mission to torment. Whether it was belittling him or bullying him for deceased family members. I would even make fake accounts pretending to be him so that I could destroy his personal relationships. I enjoyed seeing the hell I was raining down on him every day, it was addicting."
,confessions,False,"This abuse continued for all of middle school and a year into high school until I was no longer in classes with him. Later on into high school I formed a drug problem. Not a serious one but it was still a problem, my entire high school experience was experimenting with ADHD medication, LSD, shrooms, ecstasy, weed, and of course alcohol and nicotine. My bullying persisted as well, I focused my torment towards another friend. I would call him horrible things, make up blatant lies about him for reason. Insult his own family members to his face and just be a shitty person to him in general. My motive for this? I think it was just because I saw him as a stupid human being. I have trouble grasping the emotions that others feel. I simply see people as bags of flesh that can’t think the way I think."
,confessions,True,"Let me preface this portion by saying I have never and will never physically abuse a significant other. Relationships haven’t worked for me yet. I lack remorse for many things that I do, I have little to no empathy towards others. Every relationships I’ve had I’ve never felt sorry for their personal problems. I am unable to make people feel better in moments of sadness unless I want to make myself feel better. I emotionally manipulate. (unknowingly most of the time) and I constantly bring up things that others have done to wrong me in an attempt to get them to feel like they’re in the wrong."
,confessions,True,I fail to memorize things for people and make people promises I don’t end up keeping. I tell others I will work on myself but I don’t actually try. I don’t care about others feelings yet I keep them around for reasons I’m unsure of at this point. I make snarky remarks towards others and draw issues out until they admit they are wrong. If they don’t admit they are wrong I keep making the issue spiral until they can hardly take it.
,confessions,True,I want to change my nature but I don’t put in the effort. I want to change but I forget the right things to do. I hide my nature from family members because I fear what they will think of me. I avoid any social interaction with strangers and only speak when I am spoken to. In the rare instances I do speak up I only do it for my own personal gain. I have never checked up on anyone as I do not care. I am selfish
,confessions,False,"Everybody 42M and 43F our lately been into swinger porn. We never tried it, but we think it’s real interesting. We always wonder how that lifestyle is very curious. If you’re into that lifestyle, please let us know and what you expect. If we do decide to try it what are pros or cons about it and also we are getting into taking pictures and videos and sharing. I don’t know if that swinger life as well but recently we did with a couple that we know we’re from Texas SA if you know you know so like I said if you’re into that lifestyle, get us some pointers and tell us what can we expect thank you"
,confessions,False,I lived with my girlfriend and her sister
,confessions,False,"I (M25) was driving my girlfriend (21) and her younger sister (18) and her sister had just recently lost her virginity and was telling us about her experience with her guy, she told us how even though it was her first time that she didn't think it was very good. My girlfriend started singing my praises and told her sister that I always make her cum and that I always lasted long and that she was in love with the size of my dick. Her sister was a little embarrassed now but admitted she wished she had that in her life."
,confessions,False,"Thats when my girlfriend said ""You should try fucking him, you'll love it!"" Myself and the sister were a little thrown off and protested a little, but my girlfriend informed us that she was totally serious, and began the sales person pitch on why her sister and I should fuck. We all decided that we should not do this, but my girlfriend tried one more time later that day when we got home."
,confessions,False,"When we got home my girlfriend and I started fooling around in our room, once I was hard she called for her sister ""Come see his dick!"" Her sister came to our room and opened the door and took a peek and said something like ""omg hes actually naked!"" and left."
,confessions,False,"My girlfriend then said ""I tried for you baby"" and we started fucking, and she made sure to be as loud as possible."
,confessions,False,"I later figured out, my girlfriend was cheating on me, and my suspicion is that she felt guilty about it and tried to get me extra pussy to even the playing field."
,depression,True,"It’s fucked up because people think dying is so fucking easy. People who’ve never been in this fucking pit think if you’re alive that means you want to be. Bullshit. A relatively fast, painless death is hard to come by nowadays. It takes more than a want. Hell, there’s that mental block of self preservation that’s so hard to break through. We’re hard wired not to kill ourselves or cause damage to our own bodies so it takes a lot to chip away at that. The worst part is, if you don’t have a way to end it immediately you have to keep living. Waking up every fucking day, eating, maybe going to work or school. I don’t know how to take it anymore. I feel like I’m not here anymore like I shouldn’t be here. It’s fucked because I don’t have a way to kill myself right now so I have to keep going. It’s cruel. I feel bad for other people going through this shit. It’s just all for nothing. I’m not gonna live for very long anyways so why get a degree or take care of my teeth or make friends? It’s so exhausting it just keeps wearing me down every day it’s every day. I’m seriously so done but like I said there’s no way to kill myself that would be accurate enough or fast enough or painless enough but I don’t know how to make it through another day?? Another week?? I can’t do it and I need help."
,depression,True,"Just to be clear, I’m not asking for help to hurt myself. It’s just my thoughts right now. And I apologize for the swearing."
,depression,True,"TLDR: death isn’t an option right now unfortunately, living is excruciating. What do you do to survive every day? To keep getting through it? Thank you."
,depression,True,"i've (25F) never been one to inflict physical pain upon myself. instead, i choose to inflict emotional pain upon myself, like blowing up my life."
,depression,True,"this includes reckless decision making, quitting jobs left and right, becoming homeless, cutting off my best friends and family, engaging in unprotected activities with randoms, completely stopped paying all bills, insane amounts of debt... i've been trying to figure out a reason as to why i do this to myself, and i think i'm understanding why."
,depression,True,"one, i'm very emotionally exhausted. i've been fighting depression all my life (rough upbringing, even rougher early adulthood)"
,depression,True,"and two, it's kind of oddly comforting in a way...? for example, it's obviously going to be terrible when my car gets repossessed because i stopped making payments on it (my car is the ONLY thing i have), but it’s like... if i let all these terrible things happen to me, each thing compounding into a worse thing, it would finally give me a valid reason to... you know."
,depression,True,"i don't know how to stop. i want to live a normal life, and i don't want to die, but it's like i'm addicted to ruining everything to the point where life won't be worth living anymore if i continue."
,depression,True,"i want to fight this, and i want to win. but i feel like i may be past the point of therapy. i tried a partial hospitalization program a couple months ago, and then i ended up leaving that. maybe that php program in particular just wasn't right for me, or maybe i'm past the point of rewiring my brain to get myself to stop doing this."
,depression,False,does anyone else experience this? i would love any advice. thanks for listening ❤️
,depression,True,"I (24M) feel like nothing... just, nothing. Nothing brings me joy anymore, none of my hobbies, interests, or regular activities make me happy anymore. I'm starting to feel like I'm slipping away with those around me too, my relationship with my family is terrible, I feel that I have no genuine friends I can really talk to, I'm even losing intimacy with my girlfriend and that last one really hurts. I'm just stuck at home waiting to graduate but until then, I'm forced to do nothing but just go to the gym and still feel disgusted with my body. The worst part is that I've had this feeling since my teen years. When I was in HS, I said ""College will make me feel better"". Now that I'm in college, I'm thinking ""Working will make me feel better"". I keep saying this even though I know I won't really feel better at all.. I don't know what will at this point."
,confessions,False,"I need to get this off my chest because it’s been messing with my mind lately. Me and my close male friend are both married. He has been involved with a woman who is also married, and he tells me a lot about their relationship. Sometimes a little too much."
,confessions,False,"Whenever he’s talking to her and I’m around, she ends up joining the conversation. She gets very flirty with him on call even when I can hear everything. Lately she has started trying to talk to me too. She asks him to put me on the call, tries to start conversations, and honestly it feels like she might be a little interested."
,confessions,False,And here’s my problem: I’m starting to feel attracted to her too.
,confessions,True,"I know it’s wrong. I know it’s messy. But something about the whole situation is pulling me in, and it’s confusing me. I’ve always had a fantasy about older/experienced women, and I think that’s getting mixed with the real-life situation now."
,confessions,False,"I’m not proud of it, but I needed to confess somewhere. I’m stuck between guilt, curiosity, attraction, and responsibility."
,confessions,True,"I don’t know what the right thing to do is, and I don’t want to ruin anyone’s life including my own. But the temptation is getting stronger."
,confessions,False,What should I do?
,confessions,False,Is there a market for used thongs during pregnancy that no longer fit?
,confessions,False,Asking for a friend😉
,confessions,False,I’m a fed employee. During the shutdown I had to work every day and I still haven’t been paid in full.
,confessions,False,"To be defiant, I removed the labels off mattresses in my home. I feel so dirty."
,depression,True,I am going to commit suicide on 14th March 2026
,depression,True,I wish I could forever dream it’s so damn peaceful I can’t stand waking up to this fucked life of mine I’m only happy in dreams once I wake up game over back to misery I’m tired
,depression,True,"I've been going through a pretty severe depressive episode for 4 months now after a period in my life where I had improved a lot and I thought I was finally!!! getting out of the fucking hole after a decade of wanting to die. Then I made some irreversible mistakes and now I can't stop thinking about them and it's sucking the fucking joy out of life. My therapist keeps telling me to find a hobby, do things I enjoy to think about anything else, but I just literally can't focus on anything. I see people who all have their own niches and specific interests and I am just like. sitting here rotting. I don't know what I like anymore. Can't focus on writing, video games, tv shows, reading, sports. I'm so fucking tired and I feel like I'm just letting time go by. What do you guys do that you enjoy?? How do I remember how to find joy again??"
,confessions,False,Last month i met my long time gf after work and we drank beer.. we usually engage in touching and masterbation regularly but sex was always off the table which i respected her.
,confessions,False,But that day was different she was drinking in my car and i know after she drunk she becomes horny af. So i started touching herwhuch she was resisting. After a while she said i was hungry to which i said let me park the car and take you. But suddenly she said i want to have sex and she kissed me and asked me to book a hotel. I booked a 5 sstar hotel nearby and we checked in.
,confessions,False,I ordered condoms from blinkit and i went down to receive them but the time i came back her pants were already off. I knew she is dripping with cum down there. I started kissing her and and touching her boobs.
,confessions,False,"I threw her on bed and she removed her white panties and panty liner and threw it ,open her legs and asked me lick it,i licked it and put my fingers inside her pussy. I whispered to turn around as i wanted to pay with her ass which she always denied but that day she obeyed. I used her pussy cum to lube her asshole and rubbed it she was moaning my name and i inserted my fingers inside her asshole and she screamed at the top of her voices. I kept on fingering her and then after a while i kissed her."
,confessions,False,"I removed her shirt and bra and pulled down my pants and took out my dick she took it in her hands and gave me a good hj. She them spit on my dick and took the condom out(it was her first time). Layed her down in missionary and rubbed my dick over her pusssy and teased her and them i put it inside slowly. I fucked her in missionary and after i while i ashed her to be in doggy,we fucked for good 20 min. She asked me stop and said come close and sleep with me her and took my hands and placed it on her boobs. We we romantically sleep and whispering,i said that i wanted to creampie her one day."
,confessions,False,"She nodded in a whisper and said “abhi nhi”,she got up and said i wanted us to have sex in shower and and bath her “ache se”. We filled the bath tuba nd slowly in applied the soap on her body and she turned around and asked me to rub her back and ass. Which i did i i put my fingers inside in her ass again.she was in doggy position. I put my fingers inside inside her and made her cum and sucked her boobies and pussy until she asked me to stop. She said i wanted to give you a hj and make you cum. She obliged after and made me cum. We them kissed again and had sex on washrooms counter and licked her pussy."
,confessions,False,"She asked me to go and get ready as hotel time was almost done,after a while I heard her blow dry her hair wirh towel wrapped around her,i removed the towel and fingered her while she blow dries her hair.we then got readya nd kissed each other before we checked out. It was an amazing day ,i asked her we should do it once a month to which she agreed. But i dont know what happened after that she broke up our 3 yrs of relationship. I was sad but atleast i got to fick that virgin pussy and i dont feel sad about the break up."
,confessions,False,"I’m 21 years old and i was messaged my some man on reddit saying that he will give me money for nudes. I ignored him for a couple of weeks, but then i finally gave in. I asked if he could send half the money now and half the money after i sent the photos, but he insisted that i could trust him and sent me photos of payments he made to other girls. i was stupid enough to believe him enough to send the photos first. He wanted my face in all the pictures aswell, which i sent. Pictures in different poses and angles, all with my face in them. then he wanted me to send a pic of a cucumber in my ass, which i refused to do. He tried to convince me, but i kept on refusing. After that he didn’t reply to me and i panicked and deleted all the photos i sent to him on the chat (he probably saved the pictures anyway). and i think after i sent him a couple of more messages asking him where he was , he blocked me or deleted all his messages. i can still see his profile but i don’t know if im blocked. So i sent him maybe 15 pictures and he ghosted and never paid. I feel like an idiot tbh, and i don’t know what to do. i’m concerned about what he will do with the photos, especially because my face is on them. Any advice??"
,confessions,False,edit : this is his profile https://www.reddit.com/u/Formal-Software3057/s/RLD1rhr3Sr
,depression,True,"I apologise if this post is too long. I won't be editing it after writing, so the grammar can be messy, plus I don't think I can articulate my thoughts well right now."
,depression,True,"I am younger than eighteen, living with my parents who provide me with basic necessities and so much more than that, but I still feel so empty inside. I have everything I could want since I don't crave a luxurious life or expensive clothes. I score exceptionally well in my classes, I am healthy, social, and not ugly at all. I'm included in groups, people respect me and my childhood trauma (father was abusive towards mother) has healed, he has changed for the better. There's no such problem in my life, I just can't feel anything."
,depression,False,"Often, whenever I see someone struggling, I don't feel bad at all. Someone could drop dead beside me and I'd genuinely just move on from it in less than an hour. I noticed that sometimes I even force myself to cry just to feel something. Just to feel, I consume sad media like songs or movies but I don't even cry over those now."
,depression,True,"Life is so monotonous, repetitive. I know I have a long life ahead of me (the thought of having to live for even another year is exhausting) I just can't imagine a future where I feel full, where I feel like there's a purpose of living because I genuinely believe there isn't any. I feel like I'm just floating now. I wake up, get dressed, eat, school, return home, study, watch a show, eat, sleep, repeat. It's so exhausting especially since I believe all this is pointless, living is pointless. Again, I'm 99% sure it isn't depression, but I figured I'd write here anyway."
,depression,False,"I also feel quite lonely, but I don't like it when people try to talk to me. I don't like to open up to my friends because I know that they won't be able to help."
,depression,True,"I just feel hollow inside. I've lost myself completely. I feel like I'm just performing at this point. Doing what I'm supposed to do. I used to paint, now I don't enjoy that either, I just pick it up to escape studying sometimes. I have a thousand different hobbies but I'm losing interest in everything. Living feels extremely heavy right now since it's so... boring. I want to feel something again. I used to be a fan of so many bands and shows, now I don't care about those either. I genuinely have lost interest in everything, and it hurts so much because I don't even know who I am anymore. I want to die. For the longest time I wanted to kill myself, but I'm waiting for my parents and sister to die first since otherwise they'd end up blaming themselves and it'd be messy. I really don't want to live this life anymore."
,depression,True,"I cut myself. I was writing while watching YouTube and I just went on a fairly disturbing rant about how numb I am and I got a impulse to cut myself and I kept telling myself to do it and so I did and I’m just.. shocked. I’ve never done this before. I don’t know what to do. Really. I’m genuinely shocked. I want to talk to someone and I don’t know who to talk to and I’m scared I think. This doesn’t feel real. I can’t believe I just did this. I didn’t even feel it when I was doing it, I just did it."
,depression,True,"I'm sorry for posting this here, but I've just been going through a lot lately and I dont have anyone to talk to in my life. Either nobody could care less or I'm just too scared to talk to anyone else."
,confessions,False,"A few weeks ago, we barely spoke. Then one day she casually asked if I lived in the same direction and whether I could drop her home on my bike. She said it so normally, like it was the simplest thing in the world. I didn’t overthink it. But that first ride… the conversation flowed in a way I didn’t expect. It felt easy. Natural. Comfortable."
,confessions,False,"Since then, small things kept happening."
,confessions,False,"She followed me on Instagram. She noticed me drawing in the canteen and asked about it. She asked personal-but-not-too-personal questions — where I live, how far it is, how I manage. Nothing romantic, nothing inappropriate… but the energy between us shifts when we’re alone."
,confessions,False,"Around others, she’s just a colleague  normal, neutral, polite. But when it’s just me and her, she’s softer. Calmer. More open. She talks like she actually feels safe with me. And being around her feels strangely peaceful. I genuinely enjoy talking to her, and it’s been a long time since someone made me feel that understood without even trying."
,confessions,False,But here’s the part that complicates everything.
,confessions,False,"She’s recently come out of a relationship, and she still talks to all three of her exes. She even said she’s confused — whether to reconnect with someone old or move forward with someone new. Hearing that instantly made me put a guard up. I don’t want to get tangled in someone else’s unfinished emotional story."
,confessions,False,And here’s where I messed up:
,confessions,True,"My shift timing got changed, which meant I wouldn’t be able to drop her anymore. Without thinking, I asked my manager to keep my old timing… basically because of her. When I told her about it, she simply said, “It’s okay, I’ll manage my transport.” No excitement, no reaction, nothing."
,confessions,False,"And that stung. Not because she did something wrong, but because I realized my expectations were silently increasing without her doing anything to justify them. That moment told me I was getting more attached than I should."
,confessions,False,So I told my manager to keep the new timing. I needed that boundary for myself.
,confessions,False,"But here’s the honest truth I still like her. Not in a dramatic or needy way… but in a soft, quiet way. She feels like the autumn season warm, grounded, a little broken, but beautiful in her own way. There’s something about her energy that pulls me in, even though I know it might not go anywhere."
,confessions,False,Maybe it’s infatuation. Maybe it’s emotional comfort. Maybe it’s just timing.
,confessions,True,"All I know is, she understands me in a way I haven’t felt in a long time. And I don’t know where this is heading or if it’s heading anywhere at all."
,confessions,True,I’m just trying to let things be without losing myself in the process.
,confessions,True,"I know this is very specific and it might seem like a suicide fetish or something , but its more about intimacy. A man that has no social life , a man that has no lovelife , a man that was ostracised. I am suicidal myself at the moment and out of my head , so company would be nice. I dont think i could speak someone out of suicide because of my own suicidalness, but if i could i would like to and do it successfully , not 'it gets better' but give him a reason to live , for me , and have him be my reason to live too. I know this sounds dark , but i wouldnt take advantage of that. I might be scared that he'd actually do it , but it would be nice while it lasted. I know a man (ill try not to specify so nobody finds out) he is a legal adult , and i heard that he was suicidal and thinking about ending his life. I also heard that he quit therapy because he couldn't be honest , because it was uncomfortable for him , hes very much like myself. Everyone around him thinks hes fine after the one session of therapy because he said he was , but i know its because hes uncomfortable about having to speak to a stranger that will send you out the moment their shift ends , whether youre crying or at rock bottom. I would like to show him that he can talk to me without having to pay me or worry about how many words he can fit in an hour. He didnt tell me any of this , I only heard about it. We aren't close or in a relationship , and he probably thinks im too young for him or unpleasant. I would also like a man like myself to comfort me , and instead of giving me the advice I wouldn't give , he would tell me that he understands and also has thought about it. He wouldn't be too hard on me but he also wouldn't lie to me and tell me things that not even he believes. He would tell me to stay for him and that hes staying for me."
,depression,False,And bothersome.
,depression,False,"Do people thrive on ridiculing like when someone is angry they keep mocking regardless of the person's nerves being snapped they just go on? And when I stand up I'll be ""vulnerable"" because I tell them this is inappropriate?"
,depression,False,"Trust me even the most well spoken person in my class one time mocked me for broken teeth. Maybe she is well spoken when it's about her image, but in reality she is disgusting."
,depression,False,"Why tf he is telling me to ""play with his"" in front of everyone? What a fool."
,depression,False,I need a to carry a stick with me from now on so people know I am mad and not mess with !
,depression,True,Anyway I'll spend the rest of my life avoiding everyone just like I am doing. It's quite peaceful WITHOUT unnecessary attention.
,depression,True,"Please if you com upon this and think you might have something helpful to say, don’t scroll past. This is destroying me and starting to destroy my social life. I can’t have a normal life and hang out with people anymore without abandoning them after. Please someone at least tell me what this is, that would be a great start already!"
,depression,False,"A lot of times, I can be normal, having a joyous day and feeling good and the something triggers me and it all starts going downhill. In a few seconds or minutes my vision starts getting more contrasty, the colors more intense and it looks like I am seeing with a “dramatic” filter on. Smells start getting more intense and I start getting grossed out very easily, and normal things make me feel sick, people look ugly and disgusting. My head starts feeling like it’s burning and my brain feels like it’s underwater. After some time I start getting a headache at the front of my head. I feel like my heartbeat gets faster but I can’t verify that. When I get in that state I just want to isolate myself, I feel absolutely horrible. These are the sintoms. They are very intense and can persist for days. This is destroying my social life because it’s like a virus. If I get triggered by something then next time if I look at something related to the time I was feeling bad or even just day something it starts happening again so I begin distancing myself and keeping people away from me I beg you, if you know what this is or have any idea on how to help me, please leave a word"
,depression,False,"I really want to finish myself off, I evaded it by putting up a Christmas tree."
,confessions,True,I've been through alot of shit in my life. I genuinely hate my life and don't see any prospects for my future... but holy shit I've never known someone who wanted to be miserable so fucking badly she makes me less miserable by proxy of sucking all the misery out of the general vicinity.
,confessions,False,She complains all the god damn fucking time. I dont mean she complained once or twice now I mean she never has anything good to say holy shit.
,confessions,False,Constant fucking nagging. She started complaining I left 30 minutes later come back still fucking complaining just in the kitchen complaining.
,confessions,False,Its like this every day dude I GET IT!!!!!!!!!! I do but at a certain point your just making yourself miserable.
,confessions,False,Complaining complaining complaining ALL YOU DO IS COMPLAIN ABOUT HOW SHIT YOUR LIFE IS. Same mother fucker who called me a failure because I yelled back at her when she started yelling up a storm at everyone because my siblings made a mess. Same women who whipped me with a belt when this happened and claimed I tried to hit her called my dad (who molested my SISTER) mom and the police because I raised a hand to try to defend myself when I literally never put my hands on ANYBODY.
,confessions,False,Holy shit do you ever fucking wonder why everyone kicks you out? Because you're fucking miserable to be around. Like she does help out and shit im not denying that she's just so...miserable. God forbid you get you get into a car with her instant road rage. All this from a supposedly good christain women who reccomends god for fucking everything???
,confessions,False,I cant help but think sometimes... yeah maybe the world WOULD be happier without you and I barely feel any guilt saying that like i used to because holy shit you WANT to be miserable. Atp just do it... I can't even muster up this much hatred towards my actual abusers the contant proximity is just...ugh. I don't feel good saying this about someone who's suicidal but you're pushing in your mid 30s dude get your shit together.
,confessions,True,"I (22f) live with my dad it is only me and him all my other family live abroad. I have not told any other family members or anyone in my community that my dad has been drinking heavily and has started being very violent. My dad has done a lot for me but he is battling some stress and him drinking every night has led to him even throwing glass bottles at me. He has dragged me across the floor by my hair, he has spat at me and beat my with a belt he has verbally abused me and told me I was a mistake and he begged my mother for an abortion . He will apologise when he sobers up but it has been so unbearable some nights I’ll stay at a friends house due to fear of pissing him off and being attacked. I really don’t want to get him in trouble but my friends noticed bruises on my back and it’s getting hard to hide it  but I don’t see myself ever reporting him"
,depression,True,that is something my college mate asked me a few days ago and i can't help but keep thinking about it
,depression,True,"i am depressed and have showed symptoms of it for years . i don't feel happy most of the time i usually feel empty and lonely. iv attempted sucide nearly 4 times but yet people see me as a "" happy person"""
,depression,False,"im not very sure why this comment stuck to me i mean ik people's outward personality is not the same as the inside but it's not just them every single time someone gets to know that I'm going through some stuff psycholocally there first reaction is always  ""... you?"""
,depression,False,"i mean sure ig i do make dumb jokes , talk to everyone and overall be pretty extroverted in person but in a way I'm kinda scared that no one would believe me . belive the struggles and thoughts that go through my head"
,depression,False,im sorry if this rant is dumb i just needed to vent out my thoughts somewhere
,depression,True,"Hi, i'm 20M. I'm tired, i'm not living, i don't want to be living anymore. I feel dumb for feeling this way, because honestly, apart from myself, my fears etc... My life situation is excellent. I have a very loving family, i'm doing studies in a prestigious university in science/ engineering, and will probaly make good money in the future, and my parents support me financially, and are not extremely loaded, but maybe between between middle and upper class I would say. Though they live far from me. I have everything external to have a good life. I feel bad for feeling bad. But i just feel so lonely, I have some friends but I rarely see them, I only have a few in my uni. Fact is i'm kind forcing myself not to see them more, because I don't want to ruin their college experience by being in a bad mood while there is so much thing to be happy about in uni. I struggle to make friends, my friends are all friends from before. i'm just scared of talking to people, it feels likes I have to put way too much effort, it actually physically tires me. I'm lying a bit when I say I feel bad because, I do feel bad but not really, I don't feel anything anymore, i feel empty. I don't feel anything except feeling sad for feeling nothing. My days are monotonous, I don't have any motivation anymore, I don't have the motivation to wake up in the morning, I miss a lot of classes because of it, and that makes me feel guilty. I don't have the motivation to hangout with my friends. What fucking sucks is that I know what makes me sad is not doing things, but I can't get myself to do things. I would want to change my life, changing major in Uni, making friends, just do stuff that I would enjoy, but i just can't get myself to do those things. I'm unhappy and it's all because of me. I would very much want to unalive myself, I think I would have done it already if it wasn't for my fear. not the fear of i don't know regretting or not, it's the fear of suffering during that unaliving time, and the fear of not ending up killing myself, I fear not to succeed that attempt. For someone who says he's not feeling anything, i can get the fact that it sounds preprosterous when I then say i feel bad or sad, but I just can't put words on it, like I feel both but I don't know. Sometimes i do things that make me feel good at that moment, but it just drops so quickly I feel good, then it stops. it's like i'm feeling it externally. I'm really unclear here, i know. Goddamn, this is ridiculous, I feel sad, even though, nothing bad happened in my life, it makes me feel like shit. My life does rock theoretically, i'm just not rocking with it. I don't actually belong in this subreddit since I'm doing any request for support. I know, i can only feel better by doing things myself, and I know what i should be doing, but i just can't. I am currently seeing a therapist, but it doesn't feel helpful, i'm noot doing better,a nd all the things she give me, I already know. I don't need to know myself, I know myself, I have been experiencing this for 5 years. I need a solution. And i don't know who to talk to about it other than my therapist. i don't want to bother the people around me, I don't want to make them anxious, and/or bore them."
,depression,True,"Long story short, had a rough few years, where my mental health was so bad, I really thought about ODing. I had a husband who was gone for work a lot, which didn't help.  Fast forward to now, my husband changed job, I got a new position at a small town. I like the quiet, as I lived in a pretty busy city. And now my husband got into an accident, can't work. My income alone barely covered rent and food. So other bills are piling up. Our credit score is terrible. Can't get loans and we need a car for myself to get to work but we don't have the funds for that. If I dont have a car then I will get fired from my work. If I get fired then we get evicted and become homeless. Can't even sleep in a car because we don't have one. For a bit I had to pay $40 one way, via town cab, to get to work. This thought scares me and puts me in a downward spiral. I'm trying to be strong but I'm slowly losing the battle. I had to ask a friend, who's battling cancer, for some money. My family can't help me and neither can his. I dont see the light at the end of the road."
,confessions,False,"My friends do secret Santa every year and it’s always great, but this year we have a new friend in the group who I don’t get on with. I drew her name. I was also asked to draw for another friend who couldn’t be there. Because the absent friend wasn’t there, I switched our papers and gave her the new friend, keeping the second one for myself."
,confessions,False,"So basically, I was bored one day and remembered my friend had reccomended me a anime called demon slayer. I decided to watch it 'cause I had shit else to do. But quickly realised I would likely have to pay. So I went on pinterest and found a link where I could watch every demon slayer season, so I did what any sane person would do and watched throught it all in less than five days. Then I also did the same thing to watch the infinity castle movie. And honestly? I don't feel that guilty about it. Anyways sorry for my bad grammar and have a great day♡"
,depression,False,"has anyone been told this? ""Just reach out"", "" ppl care"" no they dont, ppl don't give two fucks, well I take that back somewhat, there are some good ppl in this world that are kind and empathic, but most ppl I find are just into their own world, which is fine, but it sucks when your told to just talk to someone, and when you do you realize your just an annoyance to them,"
,depression,False,"Ppl dont want to hear about your problems, and even if they say they do eventually they get sick of you,"
,depression,True,The worst part of depression is coming to.realization your truly on your own to deal with it
,depression,True,"im planning on commiting soon but have no idea what to write in my goodbye letters, or who to write them to. i considered recording videos or something but i know i cant leave without some sort of explanation. any tips?"
,depression,True,"These tears, i cry have no meaning, I don’t know if they’re tears of joy, heartache, or sorrow. I don’t know if they mean anything or if they’re meant to be seen by anyone today or tomorrow. I don’t know if I want anyone to see these tears. They make me feel vulnerable weak less than strong. That’s not the man I want to be. I want to be strong silent. Someone who’s feared may be respected. I’m not sure. That’s a tough part of this phase of life right now. I wish I understood what the triggers are in my life. Sometimes no reason I can just start to cry. I don’t know why. I don’t know if I like that at those point in time it makes me want to be held touched like a baby. Vulnerable and Week. It’s a beautiful day outside today. Sunny blue sky light white clouds. With this is still tough to find the happiness. The beauty in all of this stuff I don’t know maybe I’m just rambling putting my thoughts onto this. Someday I’ll be accountable to all these things that I have been writing down. These tears may have meaning."
,confessions,False,"31M and I've been getting into wearing women's underwear (mostly with male sweatpants but been wearing them with jeans a little bit more) out in public and been wanting to wear jeggings/ women's pants as well. It may be an underlying attention seeking and/or sexual thing, but it's also comfortable to wear. I've had a few people that have looked and just curious what would go through your mind if it was something you saw?"
,confessions,False,Your wife is cheating on you with me and the guilt is killing me. We’ve been intimate in the back seat of your Tesla. I know for a fact that at least 3 times we were intimate on the same day you and her later were intimate.
,confessions,False,I’m sorry dude. It is really bothering me. That salty taste on her lips was not potato chips.
,depression,True,"19f, i harbor so much self hatred i don’t want to go outside ever. im such a disgusting and terrible person. i hate being at college but i also hate being home, i do not belong anywhere. i hate myself and i can’t take it anymore. everyone would be better off without me, all i do is cause problems for everyone around me. im so pathetic and im not pretty either. my life is constantly going wrong, like it’s a joke everyone else is in on except me."
,depression,True,im so ashamed of myself i don’t know how to keep living like this
,depression,True,"It never does, and I won't pretend otherwise anymore, I'm sick and tired of doing so, I don't want anything from life, I never asked for any of this, yet I have to deal with the consequences, I hate it so much"
,depression,True,"Hello. My mental health is spiraling. I started university this year and I am already falling behind because I didn't start studying on time due to my poor mental health. On top of that I am failing to make any friends and my old ones haven't responded to any of my messages in 4 days. I think I might've been too much for them due to my continuous state of depression. My home life is a mess and I don't get along with my family at all. I'm living in a dorm with a roommate which I'm not exactly comfortable with yet so I have absolutely no place where I get rest ever, when I come home on weekends it's just never ending fighting with my sister and my mom. Over the last two years I lost my sparkle, my whole personality and I'm about as dull as a dishwater. I don't know what to do anymore, I used to have all this hope and now I feel like giving up. I want to be able to live and feel happiness but at this point it just feels impossible for me. Seeing other people on campus freely enjoy friendships and life in general feels like a knife to my heart every time. I just want the pain to end and for me to be able to live, but I'm scared if the time ever comes it'll be too late for me."

,confessions,True,"TW/ Drug use, suicide"
,confessions,True,"F21. Last summer I gave myself brain damage doing drugs. I won’t get into specifics but my cognitive functioning has been diminished ever since. I have bipolar disorder and was coming out of an episode. I wasn’t psychotic, but I definitely had an elevated mood. I knew it was the smartest thing to do at the time, but the drugs were relatively normalized at my college, and after all, I was manic. This period lasted for about a month. I was also still taking heavier meds than I normally do, so I attributed any decline I experienced to that. When I tapered off, I didn’t return to the level of functioning that I thought I would."
,confessions,True,"After about a week, I realized that it could have been from the drugs I was doing, and therefore would be permanent. Words cannot describe the emotional experience of what realizing that was like. I spent the next week in bed and was unable to keep food down. I was so horrified and anxious  that I would begin to wretch after attempting to eat any meal. Academics, learning, and just generally being considered a smart person were all very important to me and I feared I had lost all of that."
,confessions,False,"My parents noticed I wasn’t ok. I told them that I was afraid I had brain damage. My dad who is a psychiatrist told me that it was probably due to a med change and a family friend who’s a nurse said her patients frequently used the same drugs as I had, assuring me that I would be fine. I would slowly get back to normal over the next few weeks. I should stop perseverating, it was just health anxiety."
,confessions,True,"In the next few days, as time went on and I didn’t notice my functioning returning, I shifted from a deep fear to a deep despair. When I told my parents the reason why, they attributed my low functioning to my mood, not my mood to my functioning. They wouldn’t even consider that I had brain damage. I really wanted to believe that they were right; that this was a typical and impermanent drop in mood associated with my mental health condition that was impacting my cognitive abilities. They told me to schedule an appointment with my psychiatrist to get a med change."
,confessions,True,"By that time, the start of my next semester of college was approaching. I really thought about staying home because I worried I wasn’t capable of doing classwork. I told my parents and they once again assured me that I was fine and hadn’t suffered brain damage. Although I’m not really sure why, I ended up returning. Maybe I thought a change of scenery would help."
,confessions,True,"A few weeks in, I was really feeling how much my cognition had slowed down. My college was considered prestigious and I was a philosophy major, making my coursework relatively demanding. I just couldn’t keep up. I started grasping at straws for any explanation as to why this wasn't permanent. Maybe it was because I had quit nicotine, maybe changing the allergy medicine I regularly take could alleviate this. Nothing worked."
,confessions,True,"At this point I was so withdrawn and hopeless I stopped seeing my friends and leaving my room except to attend class and grab food at the dining hall. I sent my mom a text telling her that the reason I’d been so depressed was because of having brain damage. Instead of accepting what I told her, she said she was sorry I felt that way, told me to schedule another appointment with my psychiatrist, and scheduled a flight to come out and meet me."
,confessions,True,"When she got there, she tried to get me out to take my mind off things. She took me on a hike. On the ride out there, I reiterated what I thought was happening to me. She compared it to the delusions I had when I was psychotic; that my mood was responsible for why I thought that. At the end of the hike, I told her I had begun keeping a journal of positive memories so that I had something for the people I love to remember after I kill myself. She held on to me and we cried. When we got back, I packed up my dorm room so that I could return home early."
,confessions,True,"When I got home, I attended a php/iop program. I got my meds changed and spent a lot of time in groups, but nothing worked. There’s no combination of words I can say or therapeutic modality I can implement that could return me to the level of functioning I was at before. I “graduated” the program when our insurance stopped covering it. At this point I kind of stopped talking about brain damage specifically. I would say things like “brain fog” and talk about how I felt like I didn’t have the same capacities, but I wouldn’t attribute it. It became obfuscated."
,confessions,True,"By now, Christmas time had come around. I celebrated with my family but felt numb and hopeless through it. Every positive moment was clouded by it."
,confessions,True,"Days sort of just faded into each other at this point. I wasn’t working, I wasn’t in school, and I had no social network. I started drinking. Not every night, but I would overdo it when I did. It was the only time I didn’t feel terrible. I was still suicidal and had written and crumpled up multiple notes. The only reason I was still alive was because I wanted to stay here for the people I loved and felt like I hadn’t written enough stuff to leave behind to give my family closure. This might sound like a lighthearted way of putting it given the stakes, but I didn’t want to leave them hanging."
,confessions,True,"One night, when I was particularly down, I told my parents that I wanted to kill myself. They tried to reassure me that I had an important voice and so many reasons to live. My mom started hyperventilating and silently cried. After that night, they decided that it would be good for me to go back into treatment. This time they found a really expensive one out of town and sent me there. I wanted to go, too, although I didn’t have much hope for it actually making me better."
,confessions,True,"While I was there, I genuinely was in a better mood than I had been for the past year or so. There were a lot of really good people that I met and socialized for the first time in forever. Still, after I left the clinic and went back to where I was staying, I would go back into the same headspace I had always been in. I would become deeply hopeless and suicidal. At this point, I also began perseverating on how this could have been avoided or gone differently. There hasn’t been a night of going to bed in the last year where I haven’t thought about the fact that I have brain damage and that things could have gone differently for me. I miss when I could just go to bed."
,confessions,True,"When my time at the program wrapped up, I did feel like I got a bit out of it this time. I had at least gotten better with executive functioning and identified that I needed to have community to feel ok at times. Still, I felt like I had wasted a lot of my parents money for what was effectively palliative care; it felt as though I was terminal and any interventions were only effective as far as they could numb the pain."
,confessions,True,"When I got home, I didn’t immediately regress and I have been doing better. I have more moments where I feel ok and was able to enroll at a community college to try to maybe make something of myself again. Still, there has not been a day that’s gone by where I haven’t thought about killing myself, the fact that I have brain damage, and the ways that this all didn’t need to happen."
,confessions,True,"I’m wrapping up my first semester now and have submitted applications to transfer. Despite this, I don’t have any confidence in my ability to succeed academically. Even if I can do my work well enough now, I worry that they’ll be a point where I hit a wall, won’t be able to continue my education because of my now limited capacities, and will have to drop out and go through all of this again."
,confessions,True,"I haven’t really talked to anyone about having brain damage despite the fact that it’s impacting my mood so heavily. It just sort of faded as something I talked about since hearing my parents reassure me that I was fine when I knew I wasn’t became less and less helpful. I don’t know if they still think about it at all or consider it as a possibility. My dad has brought up that he thought a med I was on could be impacting me and said it felt like he had lost his daughter. Hearing that broke my heart. Still, they say things that indicate that they’ve completely forgotten about it; that I’m a good writer; that I have an important voice in philosophy; that I’m one of the smartest people that they’ve met. Hearing it isn’t helpful and doesn’t make me feel any better. It just reminds me of how much I’ve lost and how much I’ve blown my potential."
,confessions,True,"I don’t really know what my next steps are. I think I might have the capacity to put together a semi-decent life if I tried hard enough, but I don’t know if it’s worth it. I can’t imagine a life without suicidal ideation. Maybe I could send this to my therapist or my parents or my psychiatrist, but I don’t want to go through all the pain of reifying it through disclosure just to go through the same cycle that I’ve gone through when I’ve tried to talk about it in the past and even if they know about there’s not much that can be done to fix it. We’ve thrown four different medications and probably over 100,000 dollars in treatment at it and it hasn’t gotten much better. Really it just breaks my heart. It breaks my heart to know that I have to keep living like this, it breaks my heart that I’ve deprived my friends and family of the person the knew and loved, and it breaks my heart to know the sweet, bright, happy little kid that I was had to grow up to become who I am today."
,confessions,False,"If you’re reading this, thanks. I don’t think I want anything more out of this but to send it out into the void."
,depression,True,"my parents had a brutal divorce when i was 5. my father was not great and i developed extreme anxiety and attachment to my mom. since then i have dealt with anxiety, dietary issues, depression, and an ed which i was hospitalized for, and ive been in counseling since i was 7. i’m now 19 and am suffering from an undetermined health issue that prevents me from doing really anything."
,depression,True,amid my health struggles i moved away to college and it got worse and i had to drop out. everything around me seemed to be falling apart while i watched my peers be “normal”. i really wanted to go to college and i wanted to have that experience yk? but now it doesn’t feel achievable anymore.
,depression,False,"not only have i been struggling, but my sister also had a health crisis and had to rely on my mom to pay for her care. my mom is not broke by any means but makes sure we know what she will give us money for.

,depression,True,all day everyday im in pain! i’ve had so many appointments and scans and everything has shown up fine. this has been going on for a year now and i don’t know what to do anymore. i cannot live sustainably like this or without my moms help. i have never felt more like a burden than i do now and it would all be over if i just don’t exist anymore.

,depression,True,"I'm f17 and I have been depressed probably since I was 12. I've gone to therapy for around a year, because of my anorexia mostly, but I didn't see any progress with curing depression. There is not a single day I don't think about suicide, my awful looks or my lack of personality. I was thinking about going back to therapy, but I don't want to waste my parents money - I don't plan to commit at the moment, the risks are too high for me. Here comes the question: do you think a FULL recovery is possible with long term mental health issues since young age? Are the most crucial parts of my brain arranged after puberty?"
,depression,True,"seeing photos and videos of people i used to be really close friends with being happy and just enjoying their lives gives me a pit in my stomach. knowing that i’m the only one that’s alone and miserable makes me so sad and numb. i feel like i’m the only one that thinks about them and mourns all the memories we had together, like i’m wasting away watching them from behind a cell. the annoying thing is that a part of me knows i kinda deserve being alone like this, and even if they did reach out to me again i’d feel like the biggest fucking loser on the planet telling them of the nothingness i’ve done with my life since we graduated.. i hate being me"
,confessions,False,"SO SO many times, I see people being purposely targetted by rage baiters or trolls online. Hell I was harassed for three months daily on the fortnite discord server, then banned for “instigating drama” cause i told my bullies to stop. (Yes i have a 45 page docs showing evidence). The omegle replacement sites are even worse, people are so judgmental calling people ugly, fat, laughing at others. Girls in their early twenties snickering. People skipping out of genuine chats in favour of models (who arnt even on the sites). And back to discord, people calling others chopped or unc, old or jobless etc. and don’t get me started on the ludicrous trend of using “autism” as a new word to call something not normal as a put down word. <yes i’ve witnessed it a few times."
