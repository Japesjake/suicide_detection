,depression,True,"Is it fair to say that life isnt so beautiful? Regardless of mental health problems, the mecanics behinde lifes inner workings are not so kind and nice but rather shocking and morbid. Its full of irregularities, predators, there are animale that eat their own babies and not to mention the thing that we as people do. I hear people saying all the time that life is beautiful but I think that Im not actually depressed or that depressed, but that Im just seeing the clearer picture of lifes true nature.Life is not as beautiful as its being represented.We are here probably purely because of multiple coincidences that just happend, and we have to brace and face it the best way possible.This is not a game, the world is filled with negative energies, bad people and for some reason bad luck that happens to the good ones. When you look deeply into the picture of life, the only conclusion that yoj can arrive to,if you are honest with yourself, is that its not beautiful. I embraced life as a task that I need to complete. Successful or not it has to be completed.Stay strong (sorry for bad english, im curently drunk and dont give a f for gramatics plus im not native speaker)"
,depression,True,"I'm sure this kind of post, shows up quite a lot at this time of year. That being said, here goes. The holiday's. Christmas in particular used to MEAN something to me. When I was a kid, all the way up through my late forties. My kids grew up about that point but, for the most part were all still around. Now our closest albeit, grown child is 700 miles away and tied down, caring for her boyfriend who has muscular dystrophy. Our next eldest son is, married and lives about 850 miles away, his younger brother, ( who by the way with his girl) has given us our only Grandchild, lives 40 miles north of him and, our youngest Daughter lives about 50 miles south of there. Five and a half years ago, we moved from our rental home in Florida to live with my aged Father In Law. He was in his early nineties and, was no longer safe living alone. We have not spent Christmas with our Granddaughter in over 7 years. She was one when we last saw her in person. So here we are again, facing another Christmas without our kids all because of our responsibilities to HIM. In all honesty he was 92 when we moved in and, I did not expect him to live this long. He is currently 98, closing in on 99 next May. People tell us that, we've done the right thing. That may be so but, I feel so resentful of him. The last few years, I've been depressed but, this year it is different. I feel like we will always be stuck here. He somehow, knows how I feel too. IDK how but, he does. I would never hurt him because, I'm not that kind of person but, this is putting a strain on our marriage. I'm beginning to secretly hate him and, I don't want to hate him. He has signed everything over to us and, I should be as grateful as he tells everyone that HE is. He tells anyone & everyone who will listen that, we saved his life. I feel as if our freedom suffered for it. I am so damned depressed. Okay that's it for now. I'm gonna go watch some more TV and cry myself to sleep again. PEACE."
,depression,True,"Every single day of my life, I cannot get the thought of how stupid I am out of my head. It’s my first thought when I wake up and that feeling usually just worsens throughout the day. I always find a way to fuck something up or embarrass myself. It’s a constant cycle I live in, wake up -> do stupid shit -> feel like the dumbest person alive. My brain is so low functioning, I don’t even feel like a legit person. Everyone around me feels superior, so I have this constant subhuman feeling looming over me.Now.. I’ve tried to grapple with the idea that I’m just a dummy, and have tried to tell myself things like “hey it’s okay to be stupid. you still deserve to be happy and live normally, and you aren’t really doomed to being this miserable forever,” but I struggle to accept this when I can’t see a reality in which it doesn’t completely hinder me from any kind of contentment or happiness. I’m such a dud that my mind essentially lacks the capacity to form my own thoughts and ideas. One time, an ex coworker I blocked for being a creep, told another coworker that I “can’t think for myself”. He might have been sour that I rejected him, and it’s definitely weird for a 30-something year old guy to be talking shit about an 18 yr old girl. But I don’t even think he was wrong. While he definitely said it out of spite, that thought didn’t spring from the void. For all I know that could’ve been the watered down version, and the person who told me might’ve just not wanted to tell me he flat out called me stupid. Either way, it’s not just me who thinks this. I’ve had a couple other people tell me I’m slow or dumb as well.I just wish there was SOMETHING that could make me feel worth living. A good friend to hang out with would do me wonders! Something that makes me feel like a human again. I’m so out of touch with life and myself, I feel empty most of the time. If not empty I’m very upset/depressed/mad. I genuinely don’t know what it’s like to feel fine at this point."
