,"I'm probably beating a dead horse at this point, I had heard murmurings of it yesterday.  I was nervous going in from the previews.  Turns out Miles was indeed just a silly little tutorial goofball and he even says when you go to the next area that he's going to F off and you can contact him.  Great, super enjoying the game.",False
,"em>Does anyone else feel so shy that it actually makes you sad? Like you want to talk, connect, and be part of things… but your body just freezes. How do you deal with that?”</em",False
,"Not sure what flair but here it goes Everyday I wake up of wanting to end myself. Having thoughts everyday 24/7 on when should I do it. I also have been saving money so I can least leave a savings to my family. I tried exercising lost about 10kgs (im obese btw) and though the thoughts would go away but even during that time when I am doing some workout I keep thinking its not worth it you are not going to make it you are a fuck up. Then that 10kg came back and now I fear I may get diabetes, my family has a history of it. I tried all of the distractions. I keep getting back to that point that i just keep eating and eating and just doomscrolling just staring at my screen. Even at work I just want it to end. Been thinking about it by 30 I might do it and I am just counting down. Even found a way to do it painless.",True
,I 24 F have essentially been single forever. Had a high school boyfriend but nothing serious in adulthood. And to be clear- I’m not desperately seeking a relationship. It’s definitely something I desire but something genuine.,False
,"I’m sorry for anyone that ends up having to read my bitching but I really don’t know where else to go to atp. I’m scared to die but I think my shitty life outweighs whatever fear that I have. Every day is a fight with myself to even live anymore, I’m so tired of this. I’m sorry to have to post this but I’m starting to get desperate at this point does anyone have any advice on how to not die. This will probably get buried with like 13 views and no replies but I don’t know what else to do.",True
,"I hate this illness so much. For the first time in years things are going okay, I have a loving partner, no longer completely broke, I finally have my health and I am still absolutely miserable. I feel like such a piece of shit for it too, because I am so privileged but still depressed.",True
,"I wish there was ethical suicide where I live. I wish people could understand that I don’t want to be here and I wish it wouldn’t affect them. I’m not doing anything bc my mom would be sad. But so I much I wish she could just let me go. I’m so tired. I’ve been feeling this for 20 years. I have gotten helped. I have diagnosis. I have been medicated. I have been hospitalized. I’ve done it all and I’m just so tired. I wish more than anything that I could just feel like not dying was a solution. I wish I could see the merit in existing but so taxing. I’m so tired. I am jobless I don’t even do anything, my mom is kind enough to just let me exist in her house for free as long as volunteer sometimes and even that’s too much. What is wrong with me. I wish there was just scan they could do on my brain and it’s x, y, and z. This is the treatment and I wish it would work. The last time I was taking meds I was on 11. 11 mediations for me to be capable of showering and talking, not even well, just function-able. And I feel seen and heard and I have been helped, so well and with great care, but I just have this innate need to go. I’m not supposed to be here. Here feels so wrong. I am only 27. I am only 27 and I am so broken. I just wish I could still and petrify. I am not okay as this person it’s awful here.",True
