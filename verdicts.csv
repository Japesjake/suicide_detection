,confessions,False,"All I want is to make something cool. I want to make something really good, show it to my family and prove to them, and myself, that I deserved patience, love and respect. And I fucking can't."
,confessions,False,Something in me won't let me. The only thing in life that I want and I won't do it. I'm miserable.
,confessions,True,"There's no point if I can't prove it. I'm desperate. I'm too tired for therapy, or for figuring out what's really wrong. All I want is this, and I can't have it. I hate my life."
,confessions,False,"I knew this guy for 6 years. He was the most important person in my life. I loved him, like no one I ever loved before. I know the feeling was somewhat reciprocated. He was more mentally stable than me, but I still was his best friend for 6 years. This last year we just stopped talking. I was still texting and calling, but he stopped picking up and texting back. We would see each other in person, but I left that area and he hasn’t talked to me since. I loved him so much and I can’t process this type of pain. other friends have left me, but no one as important as him. How do I cope. I have good friends, but none like him. It hurts so bad."
,confessions,True,"I lost my sparkle. I lost everything.... After breakup, I decided to leave the country and go to save some money, for my next trip I planned. Because after every breakup, I had urge to leave and go to chase my dreams. But now it's different. I'm tired, depressed, thinking everyday about ending my life. And it's been a few months, I have felt like that. I still miss him, love him, but he is living his best life without me, without any feelings for me. I'm not sure, if I will ever lose feelings for him. My job sucks, but I need money. I'm riding bicycle for 12km every morning and every evening back to the accommodation after work and here in Netherlands is mainly raining during this time. I barely see the sunlight. Working 10 hours, planting flower bulbs and plants. My colleagues barely speak English and they are always blaming me, when something wrong happened with the orders we've been preparing. I kinda don't have a time for proper sleep, for cooking for myself or having chill or fun. During the weekends, I am mostly sleeping, because I'm so tired and sleep I get during the week days is not enough. I am here alone, I have no one to talk to. Accomodation where I am, which is given by company where I work, sucks. People here are just disgusting. Not cleaning dishes, toilets, there is dirt everywhere. Hot water and heating in the room are excess I don't have rn. Guys in accomodation are drinking almost every evening and talking too loud, shouting at eachother in the end, so I was forced 2x this week to leave the bed and go to ask them to be quiet, because I need to wake up at 5am and coming from work at 6-7pm. So I really don't have a time for anything else. Like thinking about cooking for myself everyday makes me anxious, not only because it takes time I will rather use for sleep, but because of the fact that everything here looks disgusting. Pots are not cleaned, dirty dishes everywhere, I saw mouse in the kitchen 2 days ago too. But I am so scared, to go back home, to my parents house and be unemployed again. Plus I am here alone... I am crying every night, even if I stopped few months ago, because I miss him, miss our relationship and time and I still have feelings for him. I feel like I lost everything and my life just sucks. There is not a single thing that makes me happy or relaxed. Every day I wish I would die, so I will not need to go to work and mainly not feel everything inside. RN I don't know what is the purpose of my life, if I still want to go to Australia. I just wish that someone will be here with me at least to give me a hug everyday, to talk to me or just to be here. Because I know I did a lot of things just by myself, alone and I did them. But now it feels different, because I am already broken inside and not seeing the light in the end of the tunnel. I feel like a loser, I feel like I am not capable. I really don't know what to do... If to stay to save money, but it will sucks or go back home to be unemployed again. And I am so tired, literally I am going back to sleep rn... Sorry I just needed to vent how I feel..."
