,depression,False,"I feel like for the past 5-10 years ive been alternating through multiple different masks, if that makes sense. I tried to take personality tests but i know what answers to pick on them to get the mbti type i “want” in the moment. Not necessarily on purpose, but i feel like i delude myself into thinking im similar to a person/character i admire."
,depression,False,i’m 26 turning 27 in June 2026 and i’m really struggling with the reality that i’m getting older and running out of time. I am in a depressive episode at the moment (the worst i have ever been) we’re in fine one minute and crying the next.
,depression,True,"I feel like I’m stuck in this stage in my relationship where we keep seeing each other’s flaws and tension is high. Lately, I’ve been feeling really low, even though I act like everything’s fine. I know he’s been distant and I’m almost certain he’s going to break up with me soon. It’s like there’s this constant, heavy dot of anxiety in my chest, and I don’t know how to deal with it. I just feel helpless and scared about what’s coming. I keep replaying every little thing he said or did, trying to guess when it will happen. I feel trapped in my own thoughts, like I can’t breathe, but I can’t bring myself to let go either. Part of me wants to fight for us, but another part knows it’s over. I just want to feel calm again, to stop this heavy knot in my chest, but right now, it feels impossible."
