,depression,True,"Is it fair to say that life isnt so beautiful? Regardless of mental health problems, the mecanics behinde lifes inner workings are not so kind and nice but rather shocking and morbid. Its full of irregularities, predators, there are animale that eat their own babies and not to mention the thing that we as people do. I hear people saying all the time that life is beautiful but I think that Im not actually depressed or that depressed, but that Im just seeing the clearer picture of lifes true nature.Life is not as beautiful as its being represented.We are here probably purely because of multiple coincidences that just happend, and we have to brace and face it the best way possible.This is not a game, the world is filled with negative energies, bad people and for some reason bad luck that happens to the good ones. When you look deeply into the picture of life, the only conclusion that yoj can arrive to,if you are honest with yourself, is that its not beautiful. I embraced life as a task that I need to complete. Successful or not it has to be completed.Stay strong (sorry for bad english, im curently drunk and dont give a f for gramatics plus im not native speaker)"
,depression,True,"I'm sure this kind of post, shows up quite a lot at this time of year. That being said, here goes. The holiday's. Christmas in particular used to MEAN something to me. When I was a kid, all the way up through my late forties. My kids grew up about that point but, for the most part were all still around. Now our closest albeit, grown child is 700 miles away and tied down, caring for her boyfriend who has muscular dystrophy. Our next eldest son is, married and lives about 850 miles away, his younger brother, ( who by the way with his girl) has given us our only Grandchild, lives 40 miles north of him and, our youngest Daughter lives about 50 miles south of there. Five and a half years ago, we moved from our rental home in Florida to live with my aged Father In Law. He was in his early nineties and, was no longer safe living alone. We have not spent Christmas with our Granddaughter in over 7 years. She was one when we last saw her in person. So here we are again, facing another Christmas without our kids all because of our responsibilities to HIM. In all honesty he was 92 when we moved in and, I did not expect him to live this long. He is currently 98, closing in on 99 next May. People tell us that, we've done the right thing. That may be so but, I feel so resentful of him. The last few years, I've been depressed but, this year it is different. I feel like we will always be stuck here. He somehow, knows how I feel too. IDK how but, he does. I would never hurt him because, I'm not that kind of person but, this is putting a strain on our marriage. I'm beginning to secretly hate him and, I don't want to hate him. He has signed everything over to us and, I should be as grateful as he tells everyone that HE is. He tells anyone & everyone who will listen that, we saved his life. I feel as if our freedom suffered for it. I am so damned depressed. Okay that's it for now. I'm gonna go watch some more TV and cry myself to sleep again. PEACE."
,depression,True,"Every single day of my life, I cannot get the thought of how stupid I am out of my head. It’s my first thought when I wake up and that feeling usually just worsens throughout the day. I always find a way to fuck something up or embarrass myself. It’s a constant cycle I live in, wake up -> do stupid shit -> feel like the dumbest person alive. My brain is so low functioning, I don’t even feel like a legit person. Everyone around me feels superior, so I have this constant subhuman feeling looming over me.Now.. I’ve tried to grapple with the idea that I’m just a dummy, and have tried to tell myself things like “hey it’s okay to be stupid. you still deserve to be happy and live normally, and you aren’t really doomed to being this miserable forever,” but I struggle to accept this when I can’t see a reality in which it doesn’t completely hinder me from any kind of contentment or happiness. I’m such a dud that my mind essentially lacks the capacity to form my own thoughts and ideas. One time, an ex coworker I blocked for being a creep, told another coworker that I “can’t think for myself”. He might have been sour that I rejected him, and it’s definitely weird for a 30-something year old guy to be talking shit about an 18 yr old girl. But I don’t even think he was wrong. While he definitely said it out of spite, that thought didn’t spring from the void. For all I know that could’ve been the watered down version, and the person who told me might’ve just not wanted to tell me he flat out called me stupid. Either way, it’s not just me who thinks this. I’ve had a couple other people tell me I’m slow or dumb as well.I just wish there was SOMETHING that could make me feel worth living. A good friend to hang out with would do me wonders! Something that makes me feel like a human again. I’m so out of touch with life and myself, I feel empty most of the time. If not empty I’m very upset/depressed/mad. I genuinely don’t know what it’s like to feel fine at this point."
,depression,True,"What side effects did you have from taking antidepressants, and which one was the hardest? I believe they just shut down all your emotions, and you become like a robot with suicidal thoughts.”"
,depression,True,Sooo I came out to my parents didn’t turn out well Christmas and trauma really makes depression worse and my depression room is sooo bad and ngl I can’t shower cause 1 the shower broke and 2 I just can’t be bothered but anyway I have to clean cause I think my depression room stresses out my girlfriend soooo fml gotta clean but also I feel like I’m getting shamed for not being super positive. I mean I’m positively certain I’m depresssd af. But like ok. Anyway any tips for cleaning while I wanna throw myself off a building?
,depression,True,"i’ve been told by numerous people, even professionals, that it “gets better”. i would think after multiple medication attempts, different therapists, a group therapy program, something would change. i’d feel some sort of relief… i don’t. i feel like ive been cursed or something. or i’m just doomed, i don’t know. from the start, it’s been bad. my first memory was sexual assault. fast forward 21 years i’ve endured so much pain, i can’t do it anymore. i haven’t done laundry or taken out the trash in more than a week or two, i can’t get myself to stand in the shower so i bathe, i get home from work and just cry. sometimes i cry at work. my parents don’t help my situation, if anything they make it worse. my family has become divided so the holidays are a reminder of that. i’m tens of thousands of dollars in debt… i don’t know what to do anymore. i feel so hopeless. every day i wake up, the feeling is instant. i feel so awful i don’t even know how to describe it. i used to say it felt like there was a void in me, but now i just feel like the void itself."
,sad,False,"Does anyone else feel so shy that it actually makes you sad? Like you want to talk, connect, and be part of things… but your body just freezes. How do you deal with that?”"
,sad,True,"Not sure what flair but here it goes Everyday I wake up of wanting to end myself. Having thoughts everyday 24/7 on when should I do it. I also have been saving money so I can least leave a savings to my family. I tried exercising lost about 10kgs (im obese btw) and though the thoughts would go away but even during that time when I am doing some workout I keep thinking its not worth it you are not going to make it you are a fuck up. Then that 10kg came back and now I fear I may get diabetes, my family has a history of it. I tried all of the distractions. I keep getting back to that point that i just keep eating and eating and just doomscrolling just staring at my screen. Even at work I just want it to end. Been thinking about it by 30 I might do it and I am just counting down. Even found a way to do it painless."
,sad,False,"I 24 F have essentially been single forever. Had a high school boyfriend but nothing serious in adulthood. And to be clear- I’m not desperately seeking a relationship. It’s definitely something I desire but something genuine.Family was strict growing up so when I became an adult they just expected me to know how to date out of nowhere. I didn’t start feeling this sad about it until ALL of my friends are in serious relationships.. I barely got to see them before and now almost never. I don’t feel that I’m ugly so maybe I’m just a late bloomer. And I know I shouldn’t compare myself but I’m now really feeling the loneliness .Not even exaggerating but everyone in my immediate circle (household,friends,even long distance friends) is in a committed relationship.  And not to sound cringe but I feel left out because I’m the ONLY single person I know so it makes me feel something is the problem with me. And I try to fake the funk like I’m completely happy but deep down I desire romance,love,companionship etcI"
,confessions,True,My mind and heart are so hurt but I keep busy no matter shat the distraction has to be so I don't feel myself falling apart. And I don't know how much longer I can keep up with it. Does anyone else know what I mean?
,confessions,False,"When I was 12 I was at my cousins house for a sleep over, (15F) and (17F), they both had a sleep over the night before so they were tired. We decided to watch TV while the adults were outside. I have always had a huge foot fetish and they had some of the best feet I've ever seen but I have always been too shy to do anything. Eventually they both fell asleep and I'm just sitting there not knowing what to do. I look over at them and realize that both of their feet are right there, not being covered by the blanket. I instantly felt the happiest that I've ever been while slowly approaching their feet. I opened my mouth and slowly moved closer until, BAM, I had their toes in my mouth. I kept going for the next 4 hours licking, sucking, massaging, anything that you can imagine I did. It was the best thing that has ever happened to me, but I sometimes feel kinda guilty about it. Do y'all think I should tell them about it and hope that they are cool with my fetish?"
,confessions,True,I've been lying to myself for all this years that I'm take actions but end up not doing anything. I ask myself is it ego or is it resentment. And I'm sick of living a lie life
,depression,True,"Stood up and looked in the mirror and decided I could live with the pain of dying by a knife over dealing with the pain of life. Then I remembered I'd have to dig through the pile of dishes that my depressed self can't find the energy to do, for my sharpest knife, and my depressed self didn't have the energy to do that. I laughed for a good minute. My mental illness won't even contribute to helping me have release. A new level of giving up. 😅"
,depression,False,I am an evil fucking piece of shit
,depression,True,"I don’t understand how people expect depressed people to be productive and get out there when they’re fighting a severe mental battle every day. It’s exhausting. How can I be productive and change my life when I’m having suicidal thoughts every day, getting high to numb the pain, and trying to talk myself off a ledge every day? I’m tired and worn out."
,depression,False,"I'm watching everyone from school get married and start having kids, all of my friends have partners and I haven't even been in a single relationship yet. I wasn't the best kid in school either, I had undiagnosed ADHD/Autism and was extremely unlikable until high school. All my friends are moving out and going to college and I haven't even secured a car yet. It's killing me inside every single day. I know you're gonna want to say ""everyone goes at their own pace"" I've tried to tell myself that for years but it's genuinely getting to me. My own pace isn't fast enough for me. What do I do? I have a job but this is the most unproductive I've ever felt in my life"
,depression,True,"Hi, 21f. I’m feeling really frustrated with myself about internalizing something stupid and for some reason the frustration is giving me these racing thoughts.I’m not someone who has a history of SH, I do deal with some SI but I’ve never acted on it. How do I get through these thoughts? They feel very overwhelming and heavy and it feels like I just need to do it. If you have any tricks on how to stop it please help me"
,depression,True,"For as long as I can remember, I feel like I'm trapped against my will. I don't like my life, who I am, or what I represent. Basically, everything about me. I used to have hope that I could change this, but I've noticed nothing good ever lasts permanently for me. It seems like time to end this useless story."
