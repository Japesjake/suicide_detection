,depression,False,"I hate this, I've attempted twice and failed, I wish someone didn't save me the second and there are times when I'm thankful I'm alive.. recently I thought I was doing better but today... Holy shit today I have been just hard on myself and have told my brother to check up on me every hour because I might just do it.... But the difference is I'm kinda scared this time... I don't want to leave my boys... I never realized how much I meant to them and honestly that's the only reason I'm still here...."
,depression,True,"But like nothing else in my life matters... I hate that I wasn't able to keep my family together, I hate that I wasn't enough. I hate that I am insignificant. I hate everything about me... I make mistake after mistake and just don't care about my life... I want to die and just give up but my boys, I just love them so much I bought them their Christmas presents already and wish I could see them opening it but I won't even have them on Christmas... So I have a feeling the closer that day gets the closer I am to committing.... Why am I so weak and not mentally strong? I thought I was over this... Why do I keep going this low, I have told my brother I felt like I was going to try tonight and he will be checking in on me every hour or so, I guess we'll see what happens."
,depression,False,Every Task or Action that I do exhausts me I would love to just fall asleep forever and Everytime something bad happens I immediately want to kill myself I don't know what to do Even if I do something I like I wanna kill myself I have no motivation I can't start new hobbies I can't study I can't do anything except waste my time Everything is so exhausting I just wanna fall asleep and never wake up bro
,depression,False,So the thing is- it was an accident- I wasn’t intending to get myself harmed- today because I needed to get some stuff still done in the evening I took more elvanse than usually- now thinking about it it was super dumb- the thing is now though I’m realy worried- I took the dose in diffrent times- the last one around between 00:00 and 01:00.i haven’t really gotten any results besides my heart beating really rapidly and me shaking uncontrollably- like not just a little twitch- more like I can’t control my body like this fully- excuse me if I have any grammar mistakes here- I can barely type right now- I’m also incredibly twitchy and my heart is pounding really loudly but I don’t have a unusually high bpmA- I’m also having slight hallucinations for example I keep seeing the items in my room melt as if they were outof wax- or I hear people speaking even though everyone is asleep and not even the tv is on - so this is the reason as to why I am making this post is because I need tips or help to for what I could do get it kinda out of my system or Or to just stop shaking- because right now i have no idea what to do since I can’t call an ambulance
