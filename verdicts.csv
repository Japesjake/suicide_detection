,depression,False,"I am tired of having my worth and entire future dependent on my GPA and grades. I went over board this semester. I took 17 credits as a sophomore so I can graduate my CC and transfer to leave my toxic household. But now I regret it.I didn’t learn anything this semester and that’s bad for a Biology major. It just felt like I was memorizing things and not understanding. I had a hard time juggling multiple art humanities with hard science classes. I couldn’t focus hard enough on my science classes because I was too busy writing papers for my two 8 week humanities classes.Now, I have to take a winter class to finish my associates and then after that I am going into university for the Spring. I really don’t want to do full time anymore. I would rather do part time at my local university. But the thing is where am I gonna stay? I can’t stay in my toxic home.I am going to have a mental breakdown really soon man I just feel it. I don’t know if it is the seasonal depression or my actual depression. It might be because of my inability to properly manage my time well, or be assertive with my boundaries. I might have to post this in r/depression …. Sorry for trauma dumping"
,depression,False,"my room is clean, I take great care of myself physically , I’m super organized and functional yet I’m so fucked up? I hate everything and i’m no one‘s first choice, this feels so fucking cringe sigha lot of how i move comes from depression and daddy issues and this constant need for validation that i hate admitting but cant escape i get attached to men easily and crave being wanted chosen prioritized even when it costs me self respect sometimes especially theni also have these weird fantasies abt being degraded and honest it makes me feel sick with myself after like im attracted to dynamics that mirror something broken inside me not bc i like being hurt but bc i want to feel desired that badlythe shame is heavy i judge myself i feel gross i feel like something might be wrong w me for wanting what i want and even knowing where it comes from doesnt make it easier bro I’m just so fucking sad"
,sad,False,"Does anyone else feel so shy that it actually makes you sad? Like you want to talk, connect, and be part of things… but your body just freezes. How do you deal with that?”"
,sad,True,"Not sure what flair but here it goes Everyday I wake up of wanting to end myself. Having thoughts everyday 24/7 on when should I do it. I also have been saving money so I can least leave a savings to my family. I tried exercising lost about 10kgs (im obese btw) and though the thoughts would go away but even during that time when I am doing some workout I keep thinking its not worth it you are not going to make it you are a fuck up. Then that 10kg came back and now I fear I may get diabetes, my family has a history of it. I tried all of the distractions. I keep getting back to that point that i just keep eating and eating and just doomscrolling just staring at my screen. Even at work I just want it to end. Been thinking about it by 30 I might do it and I am just counting down. Even found a way to do it painless."
,sad,False,"I 24 F have essentially been single forever. Had a high school boyfriend but nothing serious in adulthood. And to be clear- I’m not desperately seeking a relationship. It’s definitely something I desire but something genuine.Family was strict growing up so when I became an adult they just expected me to know how to date out of nowhere. I didn’t start feeling this sad about it until ALL of my friends are in serious relationships.. I barely got to see them before and now almost never. I don’t feel that I’m ugly so maybe I’m just a late bloomer. And I know I shouldn’t compare myself but I’m now really feeling the loneliness .Not even exaggerating but everyone in my immediate circle (household,friends,even long distance friends) is in a committed relationship.  And not to sound cringe but I feel left out because I’m the ONLY single person I know so it makes me feel something is the problem with me. And I try to fake the funk like I’m completely happy but deep down I desire romance,love,companionship etcI"
,confessions,False,"Just as the title says,  I'm lonely. I'm 30F and have been married to my husband 33M for 11 years. He choses to play videos games for 16 to 17 hours a day, and only stops when he uses the bathroom or needs food. I only see him when he is home from work for about 30 minutes during the week day. We don't have any kids and I am very thankful for this.I often go days without talking to anyone but my animals. My birthday is coming up soon and I'm going to be alone for it this year. I decided that I will take myself out to a nice dinner regardless.I know people have worse things going on in their lives. I just don't have anyone to talk to and keep things hidden from everyone in my life, so I wanted to tell someone. Thanks for reading. I hope whoever reads this gets everything they hope for in life."
,confessions,True,My mind and heart are so hurt but I keep busy no matter shat the distraction has to be so I don't feel myself falling apart. And I don't know how much longer I can keep up with it. Does anyone else know what I mean?
,confessions,False,"When I was 12 I was at my cousins house for a sleep over, (15F) and (17F), they both had a sleep over the night before so they were tired. We decided to watch TV while the adults were outside. I have always had a huge foot fetish and they had some of the best feet I've ever seen but I have always been too shy to do anything. Eventually they both fell asleep and I'm just sitting there not knowing what to do. I look over at them and realize that both of their feet are right there, not being covered by the blanket. I instantly felt the happiest that I've ever been while slowly approaching their feet. I opened my mouth and slowly moved closer until, BAM, I had their toes in my mouth. I kept going for the next 4 hours licking, sucking, massaging, anything that you can imagine I did. It was the best thing that has ever happened to me, but I sometimes feel kinda guilty about it. Do y'all think I should tell them about it and hope that they are cool with my fetish?"
,depression,True,"First let’s start off with I’d if should say depression that’s a heavy word, but anyways let’s start from the top. About a year ago I was in a relationship with a girl, first for I had ever lived with. Things were great I had a decent paying job I was happy, and then she breaks up with me on New Year’s Day, quite literally the start of the year. After she breaks up with me I start staying with a close friend and co worker, I lived in his couch for about three months until I got fired from my job due to bad performance. I want to blame that on the fact that I was an emotional wreck. Anyways shortly after I moved out and into my sister and mother’s house, I started working the worst fucking job ever and hated myself. While this was happening I also started talking to a woman who I’d always liked, I mean the most amazing woman you can imagine, things with her were going great for the first few months but I fell a lot harder than she did, we talked about our feelings often and it just kinda ended up being the same shit, I love her but she doesn’t love me. We keep seeing eachother for awhile until it becomes to much and she says that we need to cut back but stay friends. So then I’m left feeling like shit because of that. A bit after this happens I get a better job I work with a lot of great friends and I’m doing a bit better, guess what, I GET FIRED FROM THAT ONE TOO. And so now that leaves me here, working another dead end job, having the most amazing woman right there in front of me at all times. The only coping mechanism I have is my hobbies and sex and whenever I’m not doing either of those I feel like absolute shit, I’m talking laying in bed all day not wanting to get up to even piss. I kinda fucking hate my life rn and don’t even know what to do from here, now mind you everything that I’ve said so far has happened all this year. Genuinely the worst year of my lifePs sorry for dog shit grammar, I had a 1.5 gpa in hs lmfao"
,depression,True,"Not perfect, not dramatic... just gentle...l've carried so much this year... Moments I didn't want to talk about, smiles I forced to please others, decisions I made with a trembling heart. l've grown and died in ways even I didn't notice-And now, standing at the edge of the year, all I wish for this Christmas is a quiet finish. One that doesn't hurt. One that doesn't ache. One that doesn't test me again.Be kind to me. Be kind to the people I love, the people I cherish. Be kind to the people who are still figuring themselves out and fighting each day to stay alive.Let this cold winter month filled with sharp edges be left behind. Let the next year bring clarity, warmth and a little hope to everyone.We all survived something... We all deserve a gentle ending..."
,depression,True,"I felt so so desperate. I suffer from economic crisis. I have issues with my HOA. My kids are not good at their GPAs.I have done all I can to maintain this family. I always felt tired to die. I can't see any hope in my life. I need hope. Without It, I have no incentive to work hard. I don't know why I have to face so many problems."
,confessions,False,"When trying get rid of remains, best bet is to destroy them at as close to the cellular level as possible. For something like a head per se, which has key identifiers like teeth, hair, and saliva. You wanna use a tub of hydrochloric acid.Cost? It's slow and produces HORRIFICALLY putrid fumes.Benefit? It liquifies the remains completely.Mix up the burial sits across multiple state jurisdictions and land and sea burial sites. Makes it harder to track. Go twice as deep than standard 6 foot depth for land. And seal off the tub of acid, attach weight to it, and throw it in sufficiently deep bodies of water. Ideally between the hours of 12-4AMAs far as actual decapitation itself, ideally you want to use a hack-saw. Place a tarp down that covers the entire surface area of your floor with about an extra 4-5 feet of wall coverage in all directions to account for splatter. Remove the the skin, trachea, larynx, pharynx, and cut between C2-C3. This makes it easier than trying to cut through actual bone.Hacksaw:It's sturdy enough to cut through cartilage, tendons, and marrow, but manuerable enough to allow a single person to gain the physical leverage needed to clean cut lines. Never buy this OR the acid with a card. Withdrawal cash from a bank, with gloves on to avoid trace evidence, and buy each at different stores, about a month or two apart, in different counties, cities, or states. The greater the distance, the better Use different methods of transportation too. Use a rental car for one under the guise of a staycation. And use public transit for another. And change your appearance too. Use a foundation that radically alters your skin tone one of the purchases and a wig. A convincing one. Not that cheap shit from wish. But do NOT frame or implicate anybody in this. That is morally bankrupt and just bad for the soul. Handle your business like a dignified lady or gentleman. Much love💚💚"
,confessions,True,"Basically what the title says and I hate myself cus I know that I don’t want to deal with the repercussions of committing said crimes. Mostly it’s just thoughts of punching people who accuse me of being lazy for failing class events despite the fact I’ve been trying harder than her to graduate from our program. That I’ve been dealing with chronic health problems, on the verge of being homeless, car issues, and losing family members. I also wanted to slash her tires despite knowing I’d make her life harder (she has a breathalyser cus she’s an idiot who was clearing driving drunk). There’s also just the urge to dox an ex friend of mine because she’s been spreading lies about me and others and didn’t take my suicide attempt seriously. I keep telling myself jail isn’t worth it, and that I’m not gonna be a stereotype of my industry."
,confessions,False,"I am an online sex worker. I need help advertising desperately. I'm on the autism spectrum, so knowing what to put in captions is a real struggle. What advice would you give? I have a natural hour glass and big boobs and a cute butt. I know I can make good money, but I don't know how to advertise, especially myself. How do I fake that I like talking to these people as well?"
,depression,True,Having health anxiety and depression/anxiety is such a mind fuck. Because I can convince myself I’m dying of something and spiral out and then on the flip side not really want to be here anymore anyways… it just doesn’t make sense to me.
,depression,True,"I feel like I'm just forced to be here. Everything I do is just to keep myself alive- I don't find interest or excitement in anything. My life has become very chaotic lately and life feels like too much, I just want to escape. I constantly fear homelessness. I cant even imagine finding joy in being alive. How does everyone else do it? I don't want to live like this."
,depression,True,"No one ever wants me. Not romantically, not physically. And only as a second or third string friend. Yet I am always tgere for everyone. I talk to someone...and ghosted. See a Pic and ghosted. Everything. Rejected. Fucling no one one wants me and I don't know how to continue on."
,sad,False,I 24 F have essentially been single forever. Had a high school boyfriend but nothing serious in adulthood. And to be clear- I’m not desperately seeking a relationship. It’s definitely something I desire but something genuine.

,confessions,False,"This incident has stayed with me and caused a lot of lingering guilt and anxiety, especially now that I’m 18. It’s something that kept me up at night, replaying events and questioning my own judgment."
,confessions,False,"Back in 2021–2023, when I was around 16, I was a Roblox streamer on TikTok Live. I mainly streamed the game ""Da Hood"" (basically some ""hood"" roblox game), where I interacted heavily with viewers by taking challenges, doing 1v1's with in game weapons, talking with chat, and hanging with the Da Hood community. One thing I became known for during these streams was “rizzing up” Roblox girls, essentially flirting in-game and sometimes trying to get their Instagram or befriend them on Roblox. Whenever I did this, my viewership would spike significantly, often jumping from around 1,000 viewers to 3,000, so obviously it enticed me to do it more."
,confessions,False,"Now that we got the context out of the way, one day during one of my more “chill streams”, I befriended these three girls that joined my game through my live, and long story short, they ended up joining a discord server for my server where I had a lot of my IRL friends that knew about my streaming career, and other fans. She ended up getting very close to me, messaging me and facetiming me every night, at this time I thought she was born 2006 (im born 2007), and she lived only 25 minutes from me (so technically not online dating), so I was more than fine with being with her. She ended up admitting she was the same age as me (2007) and honestly I forgave her since I knew girls usually bump up their age a year up or down depending on the age of the person they were interested in, and she knew the ages of my friends beforehand (2006-2005) so she probably assumed I was born 2006."
,confessions,False,"We ended up hanging out a couple of times, and the most we ever did was kiss (which she initiated). She was funny, matched my personality, and we understood eachothers jokes and genuinely found each other attractive. A weird, notable, moment is when she sent a long voice message of her super drunk hanging out with her dad, and her dad was telling her about how she would eventually have to give me oral sex and lose her virginity to me, saying it was natural and necessary for a girlfriend to do, bringing up his wife as an example. To me...this was super weird and honestly disgusting but I brushed it off since I know people have different relationships with their parents and it's not really my place to judge...and to be fully honest I wasn't interested in anything sexual, I liked her, I didn't have lust for her, if that makes sense."
,confessions,False,"One day when we were hanging out, she said “omg imagine we just went into that club right now, literally just two 13 year olds” then she began laughing. I froze in shock, and I’m like WTF?! I asked her what she meant and she said “I meant 16, I said 13 since you have a baby face”. I acted like it was okay but like, my heart literally froze for probably like 5 minutes straight. I went to my friends and discussed it immediately, and we decided to confront her about it, she did this little pissed off face, and I knew she was insecure about how she looked, so I felt bad and told her we could walk away and talk in private if she wants. Later in the night, I was talking about it with her, then I decided to do some deep research then found out some of her friends were in grade 9-10, some even as young as grade 8. This was more than enough, so I asked her for her ID, and she hesitated so much, and I ended up breaking up with her."
,confessions,False,"She ended up calling me, showing me her HEAVILY-edited ID, which I immediately pointed out, and she showed me her real one showing she was 13 in grade 9. To me, this was disgusting. Although 2–3 years seems like nothing to some people, we are in HIGHSCHOOL, there is a massive maturity difference here. Because of this, I fully broke up with her, and unadded all her friends. Because of this, her friends retaliated (because apparently they had a crush on me too?? it got confusing here), and they sent edited screenshots of me threatening to hurt her father and sent it to my school, which resulted in cops being sent to my home during the weekend."
,confessions,False,"The cops entered my home and confronted me, saying the school received an email of photos about a girl saying that I threatened to kill her dad with screenshots of random discord messages I never said attached. My brother is insanely overprotective, he immediately started arguing with the cops and kicked them out of my house since legally, they didn't have to be inside."
,confessions,False,"This next part is the part that haunts me. My brother, after getting my blessing, managed to find the address and school of this girl through confronting her very idiotic online friends. We ended up sending an email to her school containing everything she's done, and most importantly, the audio file of her and her dad talking while drunk. A genuine police detective replied saying that the audio message was super alarming, considering her father got her drunk and had her talk about such sexual acts during her vulnerable state. I got scared here and replied saying a friend told me to send the email and they wish to remain anonymous, and the detective understood and said he already has a lot of the information he needs."
,confessions,False,That wasn't it.
,confessions,False,"We also...made a discord account containing a photo of her dad, edited to be covered in blood, with her address and a random date a month and a half ahead in the discords bio, and added all her friends, and her, on discord and other apps. We had this mindset of karma...where she made up a fallacy of her dad getting hurt so we wanted to make an illustration to kind of...teach her a lesson about lying about it. Sounds extra disgusting now that I type it out."
,confessions,False,"From this point on, I'm not really sure what happened. I've had her blocked since, and all her friends, including her, deleted all their discord accounts, etc, but I can assume she got in trouble at school, and a detective/CPS sent to her home probably confiscating all the alcohol and interrogating her dad."
,confessions,False,"I've been thinking about this more often lately. I started believing in karmic energy, as I've noticed the more good I do, the more good I get, and this is something that's stuck in my past that I feel like was genuinely wrong. I realized this after I found out her friends are the people who emailed my school, she didn't do it directly...and even if she did or pushed for it, she was literally just a kid. A dumb kid. Instead of walking away, or ignoring it, which I so easily could've done, I punished her for it even though she was literally just a dumb kid."
,confessions,False,"I probably ruined her life. That audio message of her and her dad probably could've been out of context, maybe they're just honest with eachother, and I probably ruined her family life cause of it."
,confessions,False,"I don't know if I should reach out and apologize or not. I'm in 1st yr university now...she should be in grade 11 now. She's literally a highschooler, and I don't know if I should leave it be or not, cause what I did genuinely hurts my heart, ""justified"" or not."
,confessions,True,"This whole situation is just so disgusting to me. I can't believe it's apart of my past, my history, what makes me, me. Can't even tell a lot of my friends about it they would judge me so hard so I'm just mentally stuck."
,confessions,True,"My husband died five years ago. It’s been horrible and terribly, terribly lonely. Two years ago, I sparked a relationship with an old boyfriend who was getting divorced. Things were absolutely perfect and we even talked of a future together. Until he decided to go back to his wife because of his daughter."
,confessions,False,"Since then, I’ve been kind of “dating“ a friend. He’s fairly kind and helps me around the house with remodeling and repairs. We hang out fairly often and yes, we do have sex."
,confessions,False,While this relationship seems fine. We started out as neither one of us wanting anything serious. I just didn’t wanna be alone. And I still just don’t wanna be alone.
,confessions,True,I cannot see what his feelings are. But I know he’s not in love with me and that’s fine. I’m not in love with him. I’m in love with the ex that went back to his wife. There is no contact between us and never will be again.
,confessions,False,New guy is a placeholder. Just someone to hang out with so I don’t have to be alone. Basically I have sex with him so he’ll hang out with me and help me around the house. Do not get me wrong. I’m not leading him on. We are both fully aware of our arrangement and we are great friends.
,confessions,False,"But I feel like I’m betraying my ex and myself. And frankly, the new guy, as I often think of my ex and not of him."
,confessions,True,I don’t know what to do here. I think I’m dead inside. I don’t think I can have feelings for anyone anymore. I don’t want life to be that way. If I don’t believe that happiness and love are in my future again I don’t want to continue going on.
,confessions,True,What would be the point?
,depression,True,"I don’t understand how people expect depressed people to be productive and get out there when they’re fighting a severe mental battle every day. It’s exhausting. How can I be productive and change my life when I’m having suicidal thoughts every day, getting high to numb the pain, and trying to talk myself off a ledge every day? I’m tired and worn out."
,depression,False,Trigger warning: 1. Sorry if they're are any grammar issues(f off word police)
,depression,True,2. I'm not suicidal
,depression,False,"So, I'm having bit a ""Depress episode"":"
,depression,True,"Maybe its best i go back to the silence like this past summer because. I. I just dont know what to do anymore, who if any to talk to. I'm cold, i'm tired, i'm hurt, up here🧠 but also.here💔💔💔 . They think they care but they see you and just dont know how to react or how to comfort him/her. They see you, years and years bottling everything because he used to be thr glue that held them together. Now. The gangs all split up. This state here, this state here. All into darkness and silence once past what you used to go. Who used to see and talkWhats the point loving anymore. No one has the time to care anymore. No one has the time to comfort anymore. No one wants to see me. They wish to hangout with you. Go here. Play this and this. Watch this at amc. But all they want is a night to cry on and let that pain out but instead their stuck in their own bubble, no one that can get in but one he cant get out"
,depression,False,I take such bad care of myself. I eat like shit. My bloodwork sucks. I self medicate. A huge part of it is stress and exhaustion (essentially a married single mom working full time and responsible for household work too). I’m so tired. I stopped going to the doctor. I know my heart rate is too high (resting 120). My cholesterol is high. I’m pre diabetic. Both my parents had cancer.
,depression,True,I sorta just feel like at least if I die I’ll get rest? I feel like everyone relies on me but I never get any help. Even when I ask. And I barely ever ask. I was raised to be strong and independent.
,depression,True,I try very hard to be a kind good person but everything is so hard. Never in my life has anything just been simple or easy or not like having to claw my way up for something.
,depression,True,I’ve been working since I was 12. I’m 39. I will likely never retire. I haven’t had a vacation in 12 years and that one was 3 days long. If I get sick I still have to work and still have to do everything with my son and at home. And I can’t afford divorce and I have nowhere to move if I wanted to leave. No family to help.
,depression,True,"Idk, I’m just tired and like I think I’m ok with it if a heart attack takes me out. I wouldn’t actively hurt myself. But I don’t plan to make any life style changes either."
,depression,False,It’s selfish cuz of my son but he has a god father who would care for him.
,depression,False,I guess I’m just venting. I wish I had motivation to be better but even my kid doesn’t motivate me.
,confessions,False,Is there anything wrong with me?
,confessions,True,"I think I’ve loved myself into a lonely solitude. I gave it all to myself, thought that’s what youre supposed to do. But I fell in love with my alone time, but now I’m lonely. I don’t feel connected to people the way I see them feel connected to each other. I have no best friend, I have no significant other, I had to say goodnight forever to my pet, and to too many friends. I have no one to call my own but myself.But I love myself, too much, now I’m lonely, but I enjoy it, but I’m sad and I feel alone, yet nothing helps. Feeling lost."
,confessions,False,"Hello all, I apologize in advance, this isnt some juicy secret or horrible confession,  this is one of honest relief and joy."
,confessions,False,"Growing up my mom would tell me stories about her dad, my grandpa. I knew he was a pilot in wwII, he liked to fish, he was a body repair man for cars. He raised my aunt as if she was his own. She told me second hand stories of how he'd invented something to help repair cars, not for profit or for copyrighting, but just to help him in his career. Or how he'd detested his purple heart, as most service members do, and how he'd named her Penny, after the song ""Pennies from Heaven"""
,confessions,False,"And she told me of the day he went fishing when she was 7 years old, how someone called the house and said ""theyre calling an ambulance"" and how shed said ""ok"" and hung up, but didnt say anything to her mom because she didnt want to worry her. How when she found out later that he'd died she thought it was her fault for not telling her mom, and she'd held onto that for nearly a decade before he mother soothed her guilt."
,confessions,False,"And how the only picture shed ever had of her Dad was just a side profile, taken at a wedding while she was dancing on his shoes that she'd lost at some point in her 61 years."
,confessions,True,"Fast forward to now, for the last two years ive been on a quest to find that photo, because I thought it was the only one I might be able to locate, I tried wwII archives, family, newspapers, lost photo archives and they all came up blank, finally I reached out to my cousin resigned to give her other photos for Christmas of other people she loves that have gone on, and there, buried in photo albums seldom opened, was a picture labeled with my grandpa's name. Then another. Then another. I found seven photos of him, none of them were the specific one I had been searching for so they'd gone under the radar when I asked family if they'd had photos, because everyone sans my mother who knew him in life have all gone on."
,confessions,False,"Then I found a photo of his parents. And one of his father with my mom as a girl. And for the kicker, I also found one of his mother at 11 years old."
,confessions,False,"I dont know how to wrap up this post, it isnt a question or a plea, its just yelling something good into the void for once; I did it, I found my grandpa, and im going to give the best gift I have ever given, and probably ever will. A little scrap book called ""Pennies From Heaven"" filled with faces my mom was worried shed never see again in this life."

,confessions,False,"He has 2 friend groups, he hangs out with them constantly. Watching movies online together, playing board games, pen and paper, he goes to pokémon events and goes over to their house to play pokémon together. His friends write HIM daily. He has to actively go out of his way to have alone time."
,confessions,False,"He involves me sometimes, and I'm grateful. Honestly i love when he involves me, but it does make me feel sad and embarrassed. I feel like a 3rd wheel everytime. Like ""Here's my bf, he doesn't have any friends so I'm bringing him alone"""

,confessions,False,"I have 2 online friends, the closest thing i can come to a friendship. One I'm more like her sound board, and she doesn't really pay any mind to things i say. The only I've know him for years, he's an ex of my ex. It was a poly situation, we weren't together. So it feels more like brothers. We'll text every few months just to catch up, but that's it. I've asked about gaming together. We'll play once then never again."
